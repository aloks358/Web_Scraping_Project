"VANCOUVER (Reuters) - The first phase of battle over whether Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou should be extradited to the United States wrapped up on Thursday after four days, with lawyers for Meng challenging prosecution claims that her alleged actions are a crime in Canada. ,In a Vancouver courtroom, lawyers for Meng opposed the Canadian prosecutor's arguments saying her alleged actions are not a crime in Canada because the charges of bank fraud are dependent on violating U.S. sanctions against Iran. Canada had no sanctions against Iran when the extradition process began. ,The judge said she would reserve her decision for a later date. Lawyers connected to the case expect a written judgment before April 27, when Meng is set to call evidence related to her arrest, which she alleges was improperly conducted. ,On Thursday, in their final arguments Meng's lawyer, Scott Fenton, told the judge that the U.S. request to extradite Meng is ""all and only about sanctions risk."" ,Fenton said that to side with the prosecution, and allow Meng to be extradited, would be an embarrassment to the Canadian judicial system. ,""The court is being embarrassed. There can be no fraud here because all risk to HSBC is based on underlying sanctions risk which cannot exist in Canada,"" he told the judge. ,The United States has charged Meng with bank fraud, and accused her of misleading HSBC Holdings Plc (,) about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's business in Iran. ,Court proceedings show the United States issued the arrest warrant, which Canada acted on in December 2018, because it believes Meng covered up attempts by Huawei-linked companies to sell equipment to Iran, breaking U.S. sanctions against the country. ,But Meng's legal team argued that ""double criminality,"" is the central issue in this case. Under Canadian extradition laws, a person can only be extradited if the offense they are alleged to have committed in another country is also considered illegal in Canada. This is commonly called ""double criminality."" ,Unlike the United States, Canada did not have sanctions against Iran at the time Canadian officials authorized the start of the extradition process, her lawyers have said. ,If the judge finds that double criminality has not been met, then Meng would be free. However, the prosecution could immediately appeal the decision. Legal experts have said it could be years before a final decision is reached due to appeals.    ,Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition. She entered court wearing a white polka dot dress with a long-sleeved black top and stiletto heels that she has often favored during the trial. ,Meng's lawyers acknowledge that between 2011 and 2016, Canada had economic sanctions against Iran, but that at the time the U.S. requested Meng for extradition, Canada had already done away with sanctions against Iran, ""along with the rest of the civilized world."" ,The case is therefore inherently political because it is about whether Canada imports the U.S. sanctions law — a ""political law"" — and applies it to an extradition request, said Richard Peck, one of Meng's lawyers. ,On Wednesday, prosecutors argued that Meng should be extradited on fraud charges, and that contrary to her defense argument, the case is not solely about violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran. They argued that the judge's job was to ""ensure that Canada doesn't become a safe haven for fraudsters."" ,Meng, the daughter of Huawei's billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei, remains free on bail in Canada, and has been living in a mansion in Vancouver's exclusive Shaughnessy neighborhood. ,Meng's legal team is currently only scheduled to call evidence in the last week of April, and a second phase of the trial, focusing on abuse of process and whether Canadian officials followed the law while arresting Meng, is set to begin in June. Closing arguments are expected in the last week of September and first week of October.

"PARIS (Reuters) - French prosecutors investigating a party that former Renault-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn threw for his wife at the sumptuous Versailles palace will in the next few weeks ask judges to examine the case, bringing a prosecution a step closer. ,Prosecutors have been investigating whether Ghosn - now in Lebanon after he last month fled prosecution in Japan on financial misconduct charges - knowingly used company resources to throw a party that was for private purposes.   ,An official with the prosecutor's office in Nanterre, near Paris, which has been handling the investigation, told Reuters a judge or judges would be assigned to pursue the case against Ghosn. ,The judges have wider powers than prosecutors to pursue a criminal case. They can, in certain circumstances, order the detention of a suspect pending trial, or issue an international arrest warrant if the suspect is abroad. ,Asked by Reuters to comment, Jean-Yves Le Borgne, one of Ghosn's legal team, said Ghosn had done nothing wrong over the party, but there may have been a misunderstanding between Versailles and party planners working for Ghosn. ,The lawyer said Ghosn had offered to pay back the 50,000 euros ($55,470) cost of renting the venue for the party. ,""Carlos Ghosn is ready to answer French justice. Regarding his possible travel to France, things are complicated,"" Le Borgne added, citing a travel ban imposed by Lebanese prosecutors, and an international Interpol notice requesting Ghosn's arrest, as demanded by Japanese authorities.      ,Renault did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  ,Ghosn was once a giant of the global auto industry but is now a fugitive from Japanese justice. He last month slipped out of Japan, where he was subject to strict bail conditions, managing to board a private jet to Turkey and from there flying to Lebanon, his childhood home. ,He says the Japanese charges were fabricated as part of a plot to oust him from the Renault-Nissan alliance. ,The party at Versailles, principal residence of generations of French kings until the French revolution of 1789, took place on Oct. 8, 2016. Ghosn said it was to mark the 50th birthday of his wife, Carole. ,The case revolves around whether Ghosn was aware that Renault would end up footing the bill. ,Ghosn has denied any wrongdoing. He said the event was never presented as a corporate party, and he believed the venue was being offered free to him personally as a goodwill gesture by Versailles. ,He said he was later surprised to find out that it cost 50,000 euros and that the amount had been deducted from an allocation for the use of Versailles that Renault had been given in exchange for financing a renovation of the chateau. ,However, a spokeswoman for Versailles Palace said it was clear at the time the party took place that the event was presented as corporate in nature, and that the ultimate client the venue was dealing with was Renault-Nissan. ,""There was nothing which would allow us to believe this dinner was anything other than a corporate event."" ,She said that Versailles had documents demonstrating the parties were presented as corporate events, and said that Versailles was ready to share them with investigators. She declined to disclose the documents to Reuters.      ",Business News,1/23/2020 18:42,French investigators to move ahead with Ghosn prosecution over palace party
"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - iPhone maker Apple on Thursday pushed back against EU lawmakers' call for a common charger, warning the move could hamper innovation, create a mountain of electronic waste and irk consumers. ,Apple's comments came a week after lawmakers at the European Parliament called for a common charger for all mobile phones and amended a draft law to say the ability to work with common chargers would be an essential requirement for radio equipment in the bloc. ,A move to a common charger would affect Apple more than any other companies as its iPhones and most of its products are powered by its Lightning cable, whereas Android devices are powered by USB-C connectors. ,""We believe regulation that forces conformity across the type of connector built into all smartphones stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, and would harm consumers in Europe and the economy as a whole,"" Apple said in a statement. ,It said regulation was not needed as the industry is already moving to USB-C through a connector or cable assembly.  ,""We hope the (European) Commission will continue to seek a solution that does not restrict the industry's ability to innovate,"" Apple said. ,A study by Copenhagen Economics commissioned by Apple showed that consumer harm from a regulatory-mandated move to a common charger would cost at least 1.5 billion euros, outweighing the 13 million euros in associated environmental benefits. ,The European Commission, which acts as the executive for the EU, has been pushing for a common charger for more than a decade. ,In 2009 it got four companies including Apple, Samsung, Huawei [HWT.UL] and Nokia to sign a voluntary memorandum of understanding to harmonize chargers for new models of smartphones coming into the market in 2011. ,The voluntary approach is not working and it is time to look into legislation, Commission officials said. ,""A delegated act based on the Radio Equipment Directive (RED) is one of the options to be considered since it empowers the Commission to take certain type of regulatory measures in this field,"" the one of the officials said.  ,Another option was to pass legislation on the issue. ,""...given the limitation in the scope of RED and of its empowerment, any action through ordinary legislative procedure and/or through other instruments, such as implementing measures under the Eco-design Directive should be further explored and thoroughly assessed,"" the official said. ,The Commission will publish a study around the end of the month or early February on the impact of a common charger.

"DUBLIN (Reuters) - There is no alternative to the grounded 737 MAX and it would be ""absolutely stupid"" for Boeing (,) to launch a replacement before the next wave of technology a decade from now, the head of one of the world's top aircraft lessors said on Wednesday. ,Aengus Kelly, chief executive of Aercap (,), which has committed to a fleet of 100 MAX jets, told Reuters in an interview he had spoken to all of the biggest MAX operators in the world and said they still viewed it as a very good plane.  ,Kelly was speaking after Boeing on Tuesday warned of further delays in returning its grounded 737 MAX airliner to service, with the plane not likely to be cleared by U.S. regulators until the middle of the year. ,He said that some of his customers may cancel leases, but that the majority would not and some are keen to order more.  ,""For people to say this is the end of the MAX, that is absolutely incorrect. These people don't have much insight,"" Kelly said. ,He said, however, it was still impossible to say when the MAX might fly again. ,""We saw another delay from Boeing last night – I don't think they know,"" he said. ""Is July the last delay? Who knows?"" ,Asked if the MAX might be replaced in the coming years, a move that might undermine the jet's value, Kelly said it would be absolutely stupid for Boeing to launch a replacement plane before technology allows an additional 15% reduction in fuel burn, something he believes will not happen before 2030.  ,Kelly said all of the main aviation banks were still willing to lend money against the MAX, but added if that changed, the plane's valuation would be hit.  ,""Are the lessors and the banks willing to still finance the MAX and buy the MAX? The answer to that right now is yes. And if that is the case that puts a floor on the value of the aircraft,"" he said. ,He acknowledged banks may insist on lower loan-to-value ratios on loans issued against the MAX than against rival Airbus planes.  ,Kelly said he would expect Boeing to compensate it if it is forced to take back leases and lease the plane to new airlines. Any costs due to the grounding or any fall in the planes value would also feed into talks on compensation, he said.  ,""We would expect Boeing shareholders to absorb that pain because its their fault not our shareholders,"" he said.

"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet Inc and its Google subsidiary, said on Wednesday that healthcare offers the biggest potential over the next five to 10 years for using artificial intelligence to improve outcomes, and vowed that the technology giant will heed privacy concerns. ,U.S. lawmakers have raised questions about Google's access to the health records of tens of millions of Americans. Ascension, which operates 150 hospitals and more than 50 senior living facilities across the United States, is one of Google's biggest cloud computing customers in healthcare. ,""When we work with hospitals, the data belongs to the hospitals,"" Pichai told a conference panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ,""But look at the potential here.

"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson on Wednesday forecast 2020 profit  below Wall Street estimates and said increased competition for its off-patent treatments could somewhat limit growth in the top-earning pharmaceuticals unit.  ,Shares of the healthcare conglomerate fell nearly 2% to $146.62 after it reported a rare miss on quarterly revenue, as sales of cancer drug Imbruvica and psoriasis treatment Stelara came in below lofty Wall Street estimates.  ,J&J's pharmaceuticals unit, which makes up half of the company's overall sales, has powered much of its recent growth.  ,However, generic competition for medicines such as prostate cancer drug Zytiga, coupled with pressure to hold down prescription drug price increases in the United States, has weighed on revenue.  ,Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk said the company still expects sales growth to accelerate in 2020, but it will ""probably not be as robust as we would have thought this time last year."" ,He said J&J did not take as big a hit from generic and biosimilar competition in 2019 as feared, and that the company hoped its off-patent branded products could maintain market share into 2020. ,J&J expects full-year 2020 adjusted earnings of $8.95 to $9.10 per share, with a midpoint below current analysts' average estimates at the top of the range. ,Important newer drugs posted double-digit sales gains in the fourth quarter but missed analysts' forecasts.  ,Stelara rose 17.7% to $1.70 billion, short of Credit Suisse's estimate of $1.79 billion, while Imbruvica sales jumped  24.5% to $875 million, but still came up short of the brokerage's estimate of $907 million. ,Pharmaceutical sales rose 3.5% to $10.55 billion in the fourth quarter, but failed to reach Wall Street estimates of  $10.63 billion, according Refinitiv data. ,Overall sales rose 1.7% to $20.75 billion, below the average analyst estimate of $20.80 billion, marking the company's first revenue miss in at least eight quarters. ,The company said it will not actively participate in a U.S. Food and Drug Administration hearing early next month to discuss testing methods for talc. ,""We certainly welcome any discussion around the safety and efficacy of the product...

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Most Wall Street banks announced their fourth quarter profits beat industry expectations last week.

"VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou returned to a Vancouver court on Tuesday, where her lawyers argued for a second straight day that Meng violated no Canadian laws and should not be extradited to the United States on charges she violated its sanctions. ,Meng, 47, arrived in a Vancouver courtroom on Monday for the first phase of a hearing that will last at least four days, during which her legal team argued that ""double criminality"" was at the heart of the case, as China repeated its call for Canada to release her. ,The United States has charged Meng with bank fraud, and accused her of misleading HSBC Holdings Plc about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's [HWT.UL] business in Iran. ,Meng sat beside her translator at a desk, behind her legal team. ,Tuesday's hearing began with a nearly half-hour long back-and-forth between defense lawyer Eric Gottardi and the British Columbia Supreme Court Judge Heather Holmes. Gottardi attempted to answer a question that Holmes had asked Monday, about whether Meng's alleged bank fraud against HSBC could be construed as a fraud if it had happened Canada. ,In Gottardi's written argument submitted to the judge on Tuesday, and which he explained verbally to the court room, he said 'no.' ,""The bank would face no risk of legal liability in Canada under Canadian law as there are no legal consequences in Canada for engaging in dollar transactions related to Iran and the bank is an innocent victim,"" he wrote.  ,During the morning recess, Meng, wearing a long black wool coat and stiletto heeled shoes, laughed and chatted in the hallway with members of her more than 20-person team of associates. The hearing will continue on Wednesday morning with prosecutors expected to make statements. ,Court proceedings show the United States issued the arrest warrant, which Canada acted on in December 2018, because it believes Meng covered up attempts by Huawei-linked companies to sell equipment to Iran, breaking U.S. sanctions against the country. ,Meng, the daughter of Huawei's billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei, remains free on bail in Canada, and has been living in a mansion in Vancouver's exclusive Shaughnessy neighborhood. ,She has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition in part because her alleged conduct was not illegal in Canada, an argument commonly called ""double criminality."" ,Unlike the United States, Canada did not have sanctions against Iran at the time Canadian officials authorized the start of the extradition process, her lawyers have said. ,Defense lawyer Scott Fenton argued that for the court to say Meng committed fraud it would ""have to import U.S. sanctions laws (against Iran) to Canada to supply the risk."" ,Fenton also argued against the alleged fraud by saying that if evidence were to show that the banks knew about Huawei's dealings with Iran, and were willfully engaging in risk, then ""they're not innocent victims."" ,""Then there's no materiality, there's no causation element between the misrepresentation and the willful conduct, it disappears,"" he said. ,Meng's legal team is currently only scheduled to call evidence in the last week of April, and a second phase of the extradition hearing, focusing on abuse of process and whether Canadian officials followed the law while arresting Meng, is set to begin in June. Closing arguments are expected in the last week of September and first week of October. ,Legal experts have said it could be years before a final decision is reached in the case, since Canada's justice system allows many decisions to be appealed. ,The case has had a chilling effect on relations between Ottawa and Beijing. China has called Meng's arrest politically motivated. ,Lawyer Richard Kurland, who is not directly involved with the case, said this hearing has tremendous implications for Canadian extradition law. ,""The public interest here is to examine whether Canada can possibly become a sanctuary for people who violated foreign law outside of Canada,"" Kurland added.

That stance allowed for the ""traitorous eight"" who left their jobs at Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory for a rival in the late 1950s and who eventually spawned dozens of companies, including Intel Corp. ,Apple filed the lawsuit in Santa Clara County Superior Court against Gerard Williams III, who left the company last year after more than nine years as chief architect for the custom processors that power iPhones and iPads to start Nuvia Inc, which is designing chips for servers.  ,Judge Mark H. Pierce last week issued a tentative ruling allowing the case to proceed but barring Apple from seeking punitive damages. Pierce will decide after a hearing on Tuesday whether to make his ruling final.  ,Apple sued Williams in August, alleging that he breached an intellectual property agreement and a duty of loyalty to the company by planning his new startup while on company time at Apple, spending hours on the phone with colleagues who eventually joined the venture. ,Apple declined to comment on the case. Through a spokesman, Williams declined to comment. Apple is not suing Nuvia itself or any of Williams' co-founders and it did not allege any intellectual property or trade secret theft. ,According to a copy of Williams' agreement that Apple attached to its complaint, the contract required that Williams ""will not plan or engage in any other employment"" that competes with Apple or is directly related to the company. ,In a filing in November, Williams argued that Apple's contract was unenforceable because California law allows employees to make some preparations to compete while still in their current job. ,Even in California, there are limits, said Cliff Palefsky, a prominent San Francisco-based employment attorney. Workers can lay some plans for a competitor on their own time, but recruiting fellow employees on company time ""gets a little dicey."" ,In his tentative ruling, Pierce wrote that ""an employee is not permitted to plan and prepare to create a competitive enterprise prior to termination if the employee does so on their employer's time and with the employer's resources."" ,The case will likely hinge the specific facts of Williams' planning for Nuvia, Palefsky said. Given that work at modern tech jobs rarely sticks to traditional business hours, it may be difficult to untangle whether calls were made during company time or personal time. ,""That phrase - that you can't plan to compete - raises a very interesting question of whether (Apple's contract) is violative of the public policy and whether the courts are going to enforce it,"" he said. ""This is going to be some groundbreaking stuff, one way or the other."" ,The court has not set a trial date.

"MILAN (Reuters) - European luxury stocks slumped across the board on Tuesday on fears that the coronavirus virus outbreak in China could hurt sales of high-end brands that had managed to weather months of protests in Hong Kong. ,Chinese shoppers account for 35% of global luxury goods sales and 90% of last year's growth in the market, according to consultancy Bain & Company, which produces closely followed forecasts for the sector. ,Such statistics illustrate the damage that could be done to luxury goods companies if health fears deter Chinese consumers from traveling or going shopping at home. ,Shares in some of the top luxury players, from industry leader LVMH (,) to the likes of Richemont (,), Burberry (,) and Gucci owner Kering (,), were down by between 1.9% and 3% on Tuesday afternoon. Declines had been as much as 4% in early trading, wiping $15 billion off the sector's market value. ,Moncler (,) is among the most exposed brands, given that it derived 43% of its revenues from Asia in 2018. The company known for its down jackets retreated 2.6% in afternoon trading. Salvatore Ferragamo (,), which ranks Asia Pacific as its top market with a 38% share of total revenue, fell 2%.     ,The death toll from the coronavirus outbreak rose to six on Tuesday and nearly 300 people were diagnosed, almost all of them in China.  ,Graphic: Europe's luxury goods sector: ,  ,The timing could hardly be worse, with hundreds of millions of people preparing to travel for the Lunar New Year, stoking concerns infection rates may accelerate during the week-long holiday that is also a peak retail season in China and overseas. ,""I think we need to fasten our seat belts for the next few days and see if this is something that the Chinese authorities can contain,"" said Bernstein research analyst Luca Solca, adding that the impact on the luxury goods industry could be felt as soon as this quarter if the outbreak spreads or accelerates. ,Before the virus scare, the sector as a whole had been trading at about 24 times 2021 earnings estimates, representing an 80% premium to the wider STOXX 600 index, according to a note by broker Equita.  ,Recent gains have been fueled by signs the industry had broadly managed to offset the sales impact from the Hong Kong protests with growth in mainland China and other Asian markets.  ,A truce reached by Washington and Beijing last week in their 18-month trade war also lifted shares in the sector, as did the prospect of solid fourth-quarter earnings for the leading players. ,""Given the recent run higher, this is as good a time as any to take profits in the luxury sector,"" one London-based trader said. ,Chinese travel booking platforms such as Trip.com (,) and Alibaba Group's (,) Fliggy said they would offer free cancellations on bookings made for Wuhan, the city that has been the epicenter of the outbreak, and some Chinese travelers told Reuters they were taking no chances and would change their plans. ,The outbreak has evoked memories of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus that also originated in China and killed nearly 800 people worldwide in 2002-03.  ,At that time, Chinese spending accounted for less than 10% of the luxury market, but the fallout from the health scare left the sector trading at less than 15 times estimated earnings, according to Bernstein.  ,Graphic: SARS and retail sales: , ",World News,1/21/2020 16:04,China virus scare sends shudder through European luxury goods sector

"BENGALURU (Reuters) - Uber (,) has sold its loss-making online food-ordering business in India to local rival Zomato in exchange for a 9.99% stake in the startup backed by China's Ant Financial. ,Zomato, valued at around $3 billion after raising money from Ant this month, will take over Uber Eats' operations from Tuesday.   ,Since launching in India in 2017, Uber Eats has struggled to gain market share and is a distant third to Tencent Holdings (,)-backed Swiggy and Zomato.  ,All three have spent heavily on deals and discounts to attract customers in a highly competitive market. ,Uber chief financial officer Nelson Chai said the move was another demonstration, following its decision to exit Uber Eats South Korea in October 2019, ""of our commitment to take a hard look at Eats markets where we do not have a path to leadership"". ,The San Francisco-based firm, which has promised to be profitable at an operational level by the end of 2021, has been trying to sell the India Eats business for a year, three sources familiar with the talks told Reuters.   ,It earlier held talks with Swiggy for a similar deal, but those fell through due to valuation and regulatory issues, two of them said. Uber and Swiggy did not respond to requests for comment. ,Uber Eats' India operations contributed just 3% of gross bookings for the business globally in the first nine months of last year, while accounting for a quarter of its adjusted operating losses, the company said. ,The unit in India made a loss of $61 million for the three months to Sept. 30 on revenue of $20 million, the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  ,Zomato reported a loss of $294 million for the year to March 2019, while Swiggy made a loss of $330 million. ,The sale will allow Uber to cut its losses and yet keep a stake in a market expected to be worth $15 billion by 2023. ,Independent brand consultant Harish Bijoor said the deal would also allow Uber to focus on its strengths. ""It should stick to what its competence is, in terms of being an aggregator of cabs,"" he said.   ,Zomato's orders per month should rise by 10 million from the 38 million to 40 million it was clocking before the deal, a source familiar with the deal said. Swiggy too receives around 40 million in monthly orders.  ,The acquisition does not guarantee that all Uber Eats customers will switch to Zomato. Online food delivery customers tend to favor companies offering the best deals, market research shows. ,Consultancy Frost and Sullivan said that even after the acquisition, Swiggy remains arguably the country's leading market player.  ,""Swiggy's diversification into a variety of last-mile delivery services, including store, package and home meal deliveries, is expected to offset any potential losses due to Zomato's acquisition of Uber Eats,"" it said in a note.

"DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia will pump the proceeds from last month's listing of oil giant Saudi Aramco into the local economy over several years, including building up the domestic defense industry amid tensions with Iran, its finance minister said on Tuesday. ,Mohammed al-Jadaan told Reuters there were ""serious efforts"" to reduce antagonism between Washington and Tehran after a top Iranian general was killed in a U.S. air strike and Iran retaliated with missile attacks against American bases in Iraq. ,""If you look at history, we in this region have managed to weather through worse geopolitical situations, including actual, real wars,"" he said in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum. ,""We in Saudi have to focus on the economy and reform ... We firmly believe the disputes can only be resolved by dialogue."" ,A string of attacks last year on tankers in Gulf waters and Saudi oil sites, including the world's largest oil processing facility, pierced Saudi defenses and threatened to derail a reform agenda aimed at diversifying the economy away from oil. ,Riyadh and Washington blame the strikes on Iran, which denies involvement but has threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz shipping channel in retaliation for sanctions placed on its crude exports by Western powers. ,The United States is sending additional military forces to Saudi Arabia, and France has deployed a radar system to bolster the kingdom's air defenses. ,Even before the recent tensions, Riyadh had begun a drive to localize 50% of military spending led by Saudi Arabian Military Industries, owned by the state Public Investment Fund (PIF). ,With nearly $30 billion coming into PIF coffers from Aramco's local share offering last month, new and existing local industries, including defense and technology, will get a boost in capital, Jadaan said. ,""We work with our military industry to develop our own military assets in the mid-term to deal with these risks, including investment by PIF,"" he added. ,The Saudi economy, the largest in the Arab world, remains dominated by hydrocarbon revenues despite plans to diversify. It has suffered in recent years because of low oil prices and austerity measures aimed at reducing a huge budget deficit. ,Jadaan said he expected to see healthier oil prices in 2020 due to solid demand, reduced output and easing trade tensions. ,He also predicted a smaller deficit by the end of the year than announced last month, when Riyadh said it could face a deficit of nearly $50 billion this year. ,Yet the International Monetary Fund on Monday lowered its forecast for Saudi Arabia's economic growth to 1.9% this year due to output cuts agreed last month with the OPEC+ group of oil producers.

"VANCOUVER/TORONTO (Reuters) - A lawyer for Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou argued on Monday that ""double criminality"" was at the center of a trial to decide whether she can be extradited to the United States, a case that has strained relations between Ottawa and Beijing. ,Meng, 47, arrived in a Vancouver courtroom wearing a dark top with polka dots, for the first phase of a trial that will last at least four days, as China repeated its call for Canada to release her. ,Legal experts have said it could be years before a final decision is reached in the case, since Canada's justice system allows many decisions to be appealed. ,The United States has charged Meng with bank fraud, and accused her of misleading HSBC Holdings Plc (,) about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's [HWT.UL] business in Iran. ,Court proceedings show the United States issued the arrest warrant, which Canada acted on in December 2018, because it believes Meng covered up attempts by Huawei-linked companies to sell equipment to Iran, breaking U.S. sanctions against the country.  ,Meng, the daughter of Huawei's billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei, remains free on bail in Canada, and has been living in a mansion in Vancouver's exclusive Shaughnessy neighborhood. ,She has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition in part because her alleged conduct was not illegal in Canada, an argument known legally as ""double criminality."" ,Unlike the United States, Canada did not have sanctions against Iran at the time Canadian officials authorized commencing with the extradition, her lawyers have said. ,The central issue is ""double criminality,"" defense lawyer Richard Peck told the court.  ,""Would we be here in the absence of U.S. sanctions law, and ... our response is no,"" Peck said. ,""In a typical case, double criminality is not contentious. This case, however, is founded on an allegation of breach of U.S. sanctions, sanctions which Canada has expressly repudiated,"" he added. ,Peck said the United States cast this matter as a case of fraud against a bank, which he described as ""an artifice"". ,""In reality, sanctions violation is the essence of the alleged misconduct ... the United States has a global interest in enforcing its Iran sanctions. Sanctions drive this case,"" Peck added. ,There are more than 150 people in the high-security basement courtroom in downtown Vancouver where the hearing is being held, including journalists from all around the world. The gallery where spectators sat quietly is separated from where the judge and lawyers sit by large sheets of glass, creating a fishbowl-like effect. ,Meng's legal team is currently only scheduled to call evidence in the last week of April, and a second phase of the trial, focusing on abuse of process and whether Canadian officials followed the law when arresting Meng, is set to begin in June. Closing arguments are expected in the last week of September and first week of October. ,The case has had a chilling effect on relations between Ottawa and Beijing. China has called Meng's arrest politically motivated. ,U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters in December 2018 he would intervene in Meng's case if it served U.S. national security interests or helped close a trade deal with China. Chrystia Freeland, Canada's foreign minister at the time,  quickly warned Washington not to politicize extradition cases. ,""The resolve of the Chinese government to protect Chinese citizens' proper legal rights is firm and unwavering,"" foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters during a daily briefing on Monday. He called Meng's case a ""serious political matter."" ,Huawei said in a statement that it stands with Meng in her pursuit of justice and freedom. ""We trust in Canada's judicial system, which will prove Ms. Meng's innocence,"" it added. , Richard Kurland, a federal policy expert and lawyer not involved with the case, called Meng's double criminality argument around the absence of Canadian sanctions against Iran a sure bet. ,""I think the defense has a slam dunk. There are no Iranian sanctions in Canada and anything (the prosecutors bring up) that's related to an Iranian sanction in Canada may well be dismissed,"" he said. ,Soon after Meng's arrest, China detained two Canadians -  former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor. China has denied their arrests were related to Meng's case. ,""The clear priority of everyone in our government ... is the release and well-being of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. That is at the heart of all the work we are doing and rightly so,"" Freeland, now Canada's deputy prime minister, told reporters in Winnipeg on the sidelines of a cabinet retreat. ,Meng's legal team argued in November that she could not be extradited as Canada did not have sanctions against Iran at the time Canadian officials authorized commencing with the extradition, meaning her conduct was not illegal. ,In response, Canada's attorney general said Meng was arrested on charges of fraud and misleading HSBC, which is a crime in both countries. ,""Our government has been clear that we are a rule-of-law country and that we honor our extradition treaty commitments. That is what we need to do and that is what we will do,"" Freeland said. ",Technology News,1/20/2020 12:26,Huawei CFO's lawyer attacks U.S. extradition case in Canadian trial
"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp (,) aims to add more plant-based food and drinks to its menu as part of the company's latest plan to become more environmentally friendly, Chief Executive Kevin Johnson said on Tuesday, prompting a surge in shares of Beyond Meat Inc (,). ,Over the past year, with the rise of companies including Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, ""plant-based"" has become a food industry buzzword and several major brands and restaurants have raced to offer such products. The plant-based meat substitute category is expected to be worth $140 billion in the next decade, according to Barclays. ,Starbucks - which sells sausage breakfast-sandwiches, chicken wraps and smoked salmon bagels with cream cheese - did not say by when it would start offering plant-based items. A spokeswoman told Reuters the company is exploring meat alternatives for its breakfast menu, but declined comment on potential suppliers. ,Shares in Beyond Meat, which makes pea-based sausages, chicken and burgers, rose as much 17.1% to $127.80. ,Starbucks also said it aims to eventually shift to reusable packaging from single-use cups and plastic, and invest in better waste-management. ,For now, the world's largest coffee chain has laid out targets for 2030 including halving landfill waste from stores, and carbon emissions from its direct operations and supply chain. The targets were informed by research from the World Wildlife Fund and sustainability consultant Quantis, Starbucks said. ,Starbucks, which uses about 6 billion cups a year at its more than 30,000 outlets, has failed in the past to meet some of its own environmental goals including making 25% of its cups reusable by 2015. The target was revised to serving 5% of its beverages in personal tumblers by 2015, which Starbucks also missed.  ,The Seattle-based company's abundant use of containers, lids and straws has been criticized by consumers as well as activist groups for decades. To be sure, some of its goals have been met, such as a 2008 plan to buy enough renewable energy certificates to power all of its company-operated stores by 2015.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple Inc (,) dropped plans to let iPhone users fully encrypt backups of their devices in the company's iCloud service after the FBI complained that the move would harm investigations, six sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.  ,The tech giant's reversal, about two years ago, has not previously been reported. It shows how much Apple has been willing to help U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies, despite taking a harder line in high-profile legal disputes with the government and casting itself as a defender of its customers' information. ,The long-running tug of war between investigators' concerns about security and tech companies' desire for user privacy moved back into the public spotlight last week, as U.S. Attorney General William Barr took the rare step of publicly calling on Apple to unlock two iPhones used by a Saudi Air Force officer who shot dead three Americans at a Pensacola, Florida naval base last month.  ,U.S. President Donald Trump piled on, accusing Apple on Twitter of refusing to unlock phones used by ""killers, drug dealers and other violent criminal elements."" Republican and Democratic senators sounded a similar theme in a December hearing, threatening legislation against end-to-end encryption, citing unrecoverable evidence of crimes against children. ,Apple did in fact did turn over the shooter's iCloud backups in the Pensacola case, and said it rejected the characterization that it ""has not provided substantive assistance.""  ,Behind the scenes, Apple has provided the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation with more sweeping help, not related to any specific probe.  ,An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the company's handling of the encryption issue or any discussions it has had with the FBI. The FBI did not respond to requests for comment on any discussions with Apple. ,More than two years ago, Apple told the FBI that it planned to offer users end-to-end encryption when storing their phone data on iCloud, according to one current and three former FBI officials and one current and one former Apple employee. ,Under that plan, primarily designed to thwart hackers, Apple would no longer have a key to unlock the encrypted data, meaning it would not be able to turn material over to authorities in a readable form even under court order.  ,In private talks with Apple soon after, representatives of the FBI's cyber crime agents and its operational technology division objected to the plan, arguing it would deny them the most effective means for gaining evidence against iPhone-using suspects, the government sources said.  ,When Apple spoke privately to the FBI about its work on phone security the following year, the end-to-end encryption plan had been dropped, according to the six sources. Reuters could not determine why exactly Apple dropped the plan.  ,""Legal killed it, for reasons you can imagine,"" another former Apple employee said he was told, without any specific mention of why the plan was dropped or if the FBI was a factor in the decision.  ,That person told Reuters the company did not want to risk being attacked by public officials for protecting criminals, sued for moving previously accessible data out of reach of government agencies or used as an excuse for new legislation against encryption.  ,""They decided they weren't going to poke the bear anymore,"" the person said, referring to Apple's court battle with the FBI in 2016 over access to an iPhone used by one of the suspects in a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California.   ,Apple appealed a court order to break into that phone for the FBI. The government dropped the proceedings when it found a contractor that could break into the phone, a common occurrence in FBI investigations. ,Two of the former FBI officials, who were not present in talks with Apple, told Reuters it appeared that the FBI's arguments that the backups provided vital evidence in thousands of cases had prevailed.  ,""It's because Apple was convinced,"" said one. ""Outside of that public spat over San Bernardino, Apple gets along with the federal government."" ,However, a former Apple employee said it was possible the encryption project was dropped for other reasons, such as concern that more customers would find themselves locked out of their data more often. ,Once the decision was made, the 10 or so experts on the Apple encryption project - variously code-named Plesio and KeyDrop - were told to stop working on the effort, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. ,Apple's decision not to proceed with end-to-end encryption of iCloud backups made the FBI's job easier.  ,The agency relies on hacking software that exploits security flaws to break into a phone. But that method requires direct access to the phone which would ordinarily tip off the user, who is often the subject of the investigation. ,Apple's iCloud, on the other hand, can be searched in secret. In the first half of last year, the period covered by Apple's most recent semiannual transparency report on requests for data it receives from government agencies, U.S. authorities armed with regular court papers asked for and obtained full device backups or other iCloud content in 1,568 cases, covering about 6,000 accounts. ,The company said it turned over at least some data for 90% of the requests it received. It turns over data more often in response to secret U.S. intelligence court directives, which sought content from more than 18,000 accounts in the first half of 2019, the most recently reported six-month period.  ,Had it proceeded with its plan, Apple would not have been able to turn over any readable data belonging to users who opted for end-to-end encryption. ,Instead of protecting all of iCloud with end-to-end encryption, Apple has shifted to focus on protecting some of the most sensitive user information, such as saved passwords and health data. ,But backed-up contact information and texts from iMessage, WhatsApp and other encrypted services remain available to Apple employees and authorities.  ,Apple is not the only tech company to have removed its own access to customers' information.  ,In October 2018, Alphabet Inc's (,) Google announced a similar system to Apple's dropped plan for secure backups. The maker of Android software, which runs on about three-quarters of the world's mobile devices, said users could back up their data to its own cloud without trusting the company with the key. ,Two people familiar with the project said Google gave no advance notice to governments, and picked a time to announce it when encryption was not in the news.  ,The company continues to offer the service but declined to comment on how many users have taken up the option. The FBI did not respond to a request for comment on Google's service or the agency's approach to it.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The bankrupt Philadelphia Energy Solutions is expected to sell its fire-damaged refinery site to real estate developer Hilco Redevelopment Partners, three sources familiar with the situation said on Tuesday. ,The agreement between PES and Hilco, a Chicago-based developer that specializes in redeveloping industrial properties, is expected to be announced as soon as Tuesday. PES and Hilco did not respond to requests for comment. A city official declined to comment. ,Any sale would have to be approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. ,A sale to Hilco would reduce the possibility that the more-than 1,300-acre (526-hectare) Philadelphia site would be resurrected as an oil refinery. ,Hilco, which has $2.5 billion of assets under management and has acquired 5,000 acres in North America, specializes in redeveloping obsolete industrial sites, according its website.  ,However, it is possible that Hilco could lease the site to a refinery, biofuels or other heavy industrial operation, two sources said.  ,The 335,000 barrel-per-day refinery is the largest and oldest on the U.S. East Coast, but was shut after a fire and series of explosions on June 21 last year that destroyed a key processing unit. PES filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy a month after the blaze and put the 150-year-old refining operation up for sale. ,There were more than a dozen initial bidders for the site. Only one of the groups, led by PES Chief Executive Officer Philip Rinaldi, had publicly stated intentions to revive the site as an oil refinery. ,A bankruptcy court hearing is set for Feb. 6, which could confirm any potential sale of the site.  ,PES had struggled financially for years and had only exited a previous bankruptcy in 2018. More than 1,000 workers were laid off after the site closed last summer, including roughly 600 United Steelworkers local union members.  ,Hundreds of other workers belonging to unions that provided  labor on a rotating basis to the refinery were also put out of work there.  ,PES's unsecured creditors, which includes companies that had long supplied contract work to PES, as well as the unions, have pushed for a buyer that would restart the refinery, according to two sources familiar with the situation. ,Community members have protested against a restart of the plant, which has been one of the city's biggest polluters.

" (This January 9 story corrects to remove erroneous references to the dates of previous policy changes in paragraphs 13, 18, 32 and 34) ,SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Online platforms including Facebook (,) and Alphabet Inc's  (,) Google face growing pressure to stop carrying political ads that contain false or misleading claims ahead of the U.S. presidential election. ,In the United States, the Communications Act prevents broadcast stations from rejecting or censoring ads from candidates for federal office once they have accepted advertising for that political race, although this does not apply to cable networks like CNN, or to social media sites, where leading presidential candidates are spending millions to target voters in the run-up to the November 2020 election.  ,The following is how social media platforms have decided to handle false or misleading claims in political ads: ,Facebook exempts politicians from its third-party fact-checking program, allowing them to run ads with false claims. ,The policy , has been attacked by regulators and lawmakers who say it could spread misinformation and cause voter suppression. Critics including Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren have also run intentionally false Facebook ads to highlight the issue. ,Facebook's Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has defended the company's stance, arguing that it does not want to stifle political speech, but he also said the company was considering ways to refine the policy. ,Facebook does fact-check content from political groups. The company also says it fact-checks politicians if they share previously debunked content and does not allow this content in ads. ,The company recently said it is making some changes to its approach to political ads, including allowing users to turn off certain ad-targeting tools. In addition, it will also make more ad audience data publicly available. ,The expanded ad audience data features will be rolled out in the first quarter of this year and Facebook plans to deploy the political ads control starting in the United States early this summer, eventually expanding this preference to more locations. ,Another change will be to allow users to choose to stop seeing ads based on an advertiser's ""Custom Audience"" and that will apply to all types of advertising, not only political ads. ,Twitter Inc (,) has banned political ads. In November, it said this will include ads that reference a political candidate, party, election or legislation, among other limits.  ,The company also said it will not allow ads that advocate for a specific outcome on political or social causes. ,""We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought,"" said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in a statement. ,Some lawmakers praised the ban but critics said Twitter's decision would benefit incumbent and hurt less well-known candidates. ,Officials from the Trump campaign, which is out-spending its Democratic rivals on Facebook and Google ads, called the ban ""dumb"" but also said it would have little effect on the president's strategy. ,The overall political ad spend for the 2018 U.S. midterm elections on Twitter was less than $3 million, Twitter's Chief Financial Officer Ned Segal said. ,""Twitter from an advertising perspective is not a player at all. Facebook and Google are the giants in political ads,"" said Steve Passwaiter, vice president of the Campaign Media Analysis Group at Kantar Media. ,Google said that it would limit audience targeting for election ads to age, gender and general location at a postal code level. ,The change means political advertisers can no longer target ads using data such as public voter records and general political affiliations such as right-leaning, left-leaning or independent. Advertisers can still do contextual targeting, such as showing ads to users watching a certain video. ,Google and its video-streaming service YouTube prohibit certain kinds of misrepresentati, in ads, such as misinformation about public voting procedures, political candidate eligibility based on age or birthplace or incorrect claims that a public figure has died. ,Google does not have a wholesale ban on politicians running false or misleading ads. In October, when former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign asked the company to take down a Trump campaign ad that it said contained false claims, a Google spokeswoman told Reuters it did not violate the site's policies. ,Snap Inc (,) allows political advertising unless the ads are misleading, deceptive or violate the terms of service on its disappearing message app Snapchat. ,The company, which recently joined Facebook, Twitter and Google in launching a public database of its political ads, defines political ads as including election-related, advocacy and issue ads. ,Snap does not ban ""attack"" ads in general, but its policy , does prohibit attacks relating to a candidate's personal life. ,The Chinese-owned video app popular with U.S. teenagers does not permit political advertising on the platform. ,In an October blog post , TikTok said that the company wants to make sure the platform continues to feel ""light-hearted and irreverent."" ,""The nature of paid political ads is not something we believe fits the TikTok platform experience,"" wrote Blake Chandlee, TikTok's vice president of global business solutions. ,The app, owned by Beijing-based tech giant ByteDance, has recently come under scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers concerned the company may be censoring politically sensitive content, and raising questions about how it stores personal data. ,Social network Reddit allows ads related to political issues and ads from political candidates at the federal level, but not for state or local elections. ,It also does not allow ads about political issues, elections or candidates outside of the United States. ,The company says , all political ads must abide by its policies that forbid ""deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising"" and that prohibit ""content that depicts intolerant or overly contentious political or cultural topics or views."" ,LinkedIn, which is owned by Microsoft Corp (,), does not allow political ads. It defines political ads , as including ""ads advocating for or against a particular candidate or ballot proposition or otherwise intended to influence an election outcome."" ,Search engine Bing, which is also owned by Microsoft, does not allow ads with political- or election-related content. ,Photo-sharing site Pinterest Inc (,) also bans political campaign ads. ,This includes advertising for political candidates, political action committees (PACs), legislation, or political issues with the intent to influence an election, according to the site's ads policy. , ,""We want to create a positive, welcoming environment for our Pinners and political campaign ads are divisive by nature,"" said Pinterest spokeswoman Jamie Favazza, who told Reuters the decision was also part of the company's strategy to address misinformation. ,A spokeswoman for Twitch told Reuters the live-streaming gaming network does not allow political advertising. ,The site does not strictly ban all issue-based advertising but the company considers whether an ad could be seen as ""political"" when it is reviewed, the spokeswoman said. ,Twitch, which is owned by Amazon.com Inc (,), is primarily a video gaming platform but also has channels focused on sports, music and politics. In recent months, political candidates such as U.S. President Donald Trump and Senator Bernie Sanders have joined the platform ahead of the 2020 election.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc (,) announced limited changes on Thursday to its approach to political ads, including allowing users to turn off certain ad-targeting tools, but defied critics' demands that it bar politicians from using its ads system to spread lies. ,Ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November 2020, the world's biggest social network has vowed to curb political manipulation of its platform.  ,Facebook failed to counter Russian interference in the 2016 election and allowed misuse of user data by defunct political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. Now, it faces intense criticism of its relatively hands-off ads policies, especially after exempting politicians' ads from fact-checking standards applied to other content. ,Facebook said it and its photo-sharing app Instagram will soon have a tool enabling individual users to choose to see fewer political and social issue ads, and will make more ad audience data publicly available. ,In contrast, Twitter Inc (,) banned political ads in October, while Alphabet Inc's Google (,) said it would stop letting advertisers target election ads using data such as public voter records and general political affiliations. Online platforms Spotify (,), Pinterest (,) and TikTok have also issued bans. ,A spokesman for the re-election campaign of President Donald Trump, which has spent more on Facebook ads than any other candidate, said the company's approach to political messages is better than those from Twitter and Google as it ""encourages more Americans to be involved in the process."" ,U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, condemned the company on Twitter for ""standing their ground on letting political figures lie to you."" She has called for Facebook's breakup on antitrust grounds.  ,In a blog post, Facebook's director of product management Rob Leathern said the company considered imposing limits like Google's, but decided against them as internal data indicated most ads run by U.S. presidential candidates are broadly targeted, at audiences larger than 250,000 people. ,Leathern wrote Facebook's polices are based ""on the principle that people should be able to hear from those who wish to lead them, warts and all."" ,Facebook will roll out the expanded audience data features in the first quarter and plans to deploy the political ads control starting in the United States this summer, eventually expanding this setting to more locations. ,Vivian Schiller, a news executive who has joined former tech employees and investors advocating for changes around the companies' handling of political advertising, took issue with Leathern's stance. ,""Allowing the targeting of political messages to narrow slivers of the electorate is the opposite of enabling public debate,"" said Schiller, who briefly headed the news unit at Twitter in 2014. ""It's akin to shadowboxing."" ,She said that once Facebook users share advertisements on their own feeds, the ""paid post"" labeling vanishes along with disclosures of who funded the messages. ,Another change Facebook is introducing will be to allow users to choose to stop seeing ads based on an advertiser's ""Custom Audience"" and that will apply to all types of advertising, not only political ads. ,The ""Custom Audiences"" feature lets advertisers upload lists of personal data they maintain, like email addresses and phone numbers. Facebook then matches that information to user accounts and shows the advertiser's content to those people. ,However, Facebook will not give users a blanket option to turn off the feature, meaning they must opt out of ads for each advertiser one by one, a spokesman told Reuters. ,The change will also not affect ad targeting via Facebook's Lookalike Audiences tool, which uses the same uploads of personal data to direct ads at people with similar characteristics to those on the lists, the spokesman said. ,Leathern said in the post the company would make new information publicly available about the audience size of political ads in its Ad Library, showing approximately how many people the advertisers aimed to reach. ,The changes followed a New York Times report this week of an internal memo by senior Facebook executive Andrew Bosworth, who told employees the company had a duty not to tilt the scales against U.S. President Donald Trump's re-election campaign. ,Bosworth, a close confidant of Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg, subsequently made his post public. He wrote that he believed Facebook was responsible for Trump's election in 2016, but not because of misinformation or Trump's work with Cambridge Analytica. ,Rather, he said, the Trump campaign used Facebook's advertising tools most effectively.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said on Tuesday it will recall 3.4 million vehicles worldwide because of an electronic defect that can result in air bags not deploying in crashes. ,The recall, which includes 2.9 million U.S. vehicles, covers 2011-2019 Corolla, 2011-2013 Matrix, 2012-2018 Avalon and 2013-2018 Avalon Hybrid vehicles and is tied to a report of one fatal crash. ,The vehicles may have an electronic control unit that does not have adequate protection against electrical noise that can occur in crashes, which could lead to incomplete or non-deployment of the air bags. It could also impede the operation of seat-belt pretensioners. ,In April, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) expanded a probe into 12.3 million potentially defective air bags covering a number of automakers, including the vehicles Toyota is recalling. ,NHTSA said in April it had identified two frontal crash events, including one fatal crash ""involving Toyota products where (electrical overstress) is suspected as the likely cause"" of air bags not deploying. Both involved newer Corolla cars. ,NHTSA said the air bags under investigation were installed in more than 12 million vehicles from 2010 through 2019 sold by Toyota, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, Honda Motor Co, Hyundai Motor Co, Kia Motors Corp and Mitsubishi. ,They were equipped with an air bag control unit initially produced by TRW Automotive Holdings Corp, which is now owned by ZF Friedrichshafen. ,In total, NHTSA said as many as eight deaths could be tied to the issue. ,Hyundai, Kia and Fiat Chrysler previously issued recalls for more than 2.5 million vehicles with the TRW air bag control units in question that might not deploy in crashes. ,When it recalled nearly 2 million vehicles for air bag non-deployments in 2016, Fiat Chrysler said it had reports of three deaths and five injuries that might be related to the defect. ,Hyundai and Kia ultimately recalled more than 1 million vehicles for air bag non-deployment concerns in 2018. Hyundai and Kia in 2018 said they had reports of four deaths and six injuries in North America tied to the issue. ,Toyota dealers will install a noise filter between the air bag control module and its wire harness if needed. ,Toyota declined to say how many deaths or injuries have been tied to the defect.

"(Reuters) - Netflix Inc has entered a new year that will be far tougher than the one it left behind. ,International growth helped the streaming video service trounce expectations in the last quarter of 2019. ,But the company acknowledged competition had an impact in the United States, where growth missed Wall Street targets - and that competition will become more global as the Disney+ service launches across Europe in March. ,Rivals including Walt Disney Co and Apple Inc are now fighting for streaming customers, and Netflix said it expects to add 7 million subscribers globally in the first quarter, below analysts' average of 8.82 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. ,For a company that has historically taken great pains to avoid mentioning competitive forces - it once called the video game Fortnite a bigger rival than other streaming services - it spent a considerable amount of time explaining why Disney's power will not have as damaging an effect on its engine of growth outside of America. ,""Despite the big debut of Disney+ and the launch of Apple TV+, our viewing per membership grew both globally and in the U.S. on a year over year basis, consistent with recent quarters,"" the company wrote in a letter to investors.  ,Netflix Chief Executive Officer Reed Hastings described the fourth quarter's 8.76 million net subscriber growth - boosted by a new season of royal drama ""The Crown"" and two films nominated for Best Picture Oscars - as ""just amazing."" ,That number beat Wall Street estimates for the fourth quarter, helping to send shares up 2.2% in volatile after-hours trading on Tuesday. ,The Disney+ and Apple TV+ streaming services both launched in the United States in November. Disney+, which is also live in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, will launch in the U.K., France, Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Austria and Switzerland on March 24. Apple TV+ is available in over 100 countries and regions. ,The Disney+ service launched in the United States and Canada for $7 per month and $13 a month for a bundle with ESPN+ and Hulu; it reached 10 million sign-ups on its first day. Apple TV+ launched Nov. 1 for $5 per month and is free for one year with the purchase of some Apple devices: its performance has been harder to define. AT&T-owner WarnerMedia's HBO Max will cost $15 per month when it launches in May. ,Netflix is available in over 190 countries; its standard U.S. plan costs $13 per month. ,Netflix has had an outsized impact on the pay TV landscape, changing the way that people consume TV and film and forcing media and tech companies to shift their business models. As streaming video has grown in the United States, the market has become more competitive, pushing Netflix to look overseas for growth. ,As such, the company has invested heavily in non-English language content, and this quarter began releasing revenue and subscriber numbers by region for the first time. It added 1.75 million subscribers in Asia-Pacific, its fastest-growing region, while Latin America grew by 2.04 million subscribers in the quarter.   ,As rivals have pulled their content off of Netflix, the company has poured money into original TV series and films. It had a $15 billion cash budget for content last year and $14.76 billion in long-term debt as of Dec. 31, 2019.  ,""Friends"" left Netflix in the United States this month and will run on HBO Max. ""The Office"" is leaving the service at the end of 2020 and will be available on Comcast-owned NBCUniversals forthcoming Peacock streaming platform next year.  ,""The streaming service's massive content and marketing budget can only be justified if the company is adding more subscribers at a robust rate. If that doesn't materialize, then its stock price will reflect that reality,"" wrote Haris Anwar, an analyst at investing.com. ,The addition of new streaming platforms - taking more out of a household's monthly entertainment budget - has also made it harder for Netflix to raise prices, as it did in the United States last year. ,Free, advertising-supported services such as Peacock and ViacomCBS-owned Pluto TV may also limit Netflix's pricing power, according to research from Citigroup.  ,Net income rose to $587 million, or $1.30 per share, in the fourth quarter from $134 million, or 30 cents per share, a year earlier. ,Total revenue rose to $5.5 billion from $4.2 billion a year earlier.

"TOKYO (Reuters) - The challenge posed by Facebook's Libra cryptocurrency likely prodded major central banks to set up a new group to study the potential for issuing their own digital currencies, a former Bank of Japan executive said on Wednesday. ,The central banks of Britain, the euro zone, Japan, Canada, Sweden and Switzerland on Tuesday announced a plan to share experiences to look at the case for issuing digital currencies, amid a growing debate over the future of money. ,Hiromi Yamaoka, former head of the BOJ's division overseeing payment and settlement systems, said the decision was a sign of how Libra has triggered a global competition among central banks to make their currencies more appealing. ,""The latest decision (by the six central banks) is not just about sharing information. It's also an effort to keep something like Libra in check,"" said Yamaoka who, during his stint at the BOJ, was directly in charge of negotiations on new technology. ,""Something like Libra would make transactions costs much cheaper. Major central banks need to appeal that they, too, are making efforts to make settlement more efficient with better use of digital technology,"" he told Reuters. ,Currently a board member at IT consulting firm Future Corp, Yamaoka oversaw the BOJ's research into digital currencies and retains close contact with global central bank policymakers. ,Central banks across the world have quickened the pace at which they are looking at issuing their own digital currencies, also known as CBDCs. Facebook's (,) push to launch its Libra cryptocurrency has added fuel to questions over whether nation states will continue to control money in the decades ahead. ,Of the major central banks, China's has emerged as the frontrunner in the drive to create its own digitized money, though details of its project are still scarce. ,The BOJ has undertaken a joint research project with the European Central Bank, but has said it has no plan to issue CBDCs in the near-term horizon. ,Yamaoka said the creation of the joint study group could speed up moves by the central banks to use blockchain technology for large-scale, wholesale settlement. ,But the hurdle for central banks issuing digital currencies for small, retail settlement remains ""very high,"" as doing so would stifle private-sector competition, he said. ,Yamaoka also countered the view, held by some academics, that central banks could deepen negative interest rates more easily by issuing digital currencies. ,""In the world of central bankers, the idea of using CBDCs to enhance the effect of monetary policy seems to have subsided somewhat,"" he said. ,""There are increasing doubts about the effect of negative interest rates as a policy tool,"" Yamaoka said. ""If so, do you want to issue CBDCs for the sake of deploying a policy with questionable effects?"" ,The more imminent factor driving central banks into studying CBDCs is the need to boost their currencies' convenience so they survive in an age of diversifying settlement means, he said. ,That is why the Federal Reserve, which issues the world's most-used currency, isn't interested in CBDCs, Yamaoka said. ,""If you want to make monetary policy effective, you need to ensure people keep using the currency you issue.""

"TOKYO (Reuters) - A lieutenant to Carlos Ghosn who is facing charges in Japan for underreporting his salary at Nissan Motor Co (,) stands a very high chance of being acquitted, as would Ghosn had he remained in Japan to face trial, a former prosecutor said. ,Lawyer Nobuo Gohara, a vocal critic of what he describes as Japan's ""hostage"" justice system, met Ghosn in Japan on a number of occasions late last year before the former Nissan chairman's dramatic escape to Lebanon last month.  ,Ghosn, whose escape to his childhood homeland breached his strict bail terms, has criticized the Japanese justice system and vowed to clear his name following the downfall one of the world's most powerful automobile industry executives. ,Both Ghosn and former Nissan director Greg Kelly face charges of financial misconduct over allegedly failing to report more than $109 million in salary, while Ghosn has also been charged with aggravated breach of trust for using company funds for personal purposes. ,Both deny wrongdoing. Kelly remains in Japan awaiting trial. ,It was not obvious that the additional salary due to Ghosn after retirement constituted a crime under Japanese law as it had yet to be paid out, said Gohara, who does not represent Ghosn or Kelly, who is accused of arranging the payments. ,""Personally I believe that there was a very high chance for Mr Ghosn to be acquitted based on the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act,"" he told reporters in Tokyo on Wednesday. ,""Likewise for Mr Kelly, there is a high likelihood that he will be acquitted as well."" ,The trial of the two men and Nissan, which is also facing the same charge, is due to begin in 2021 or 2022.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Change is afoot at BP. Incoming Chief Executive Bernard Looney plans to expand the company's climate targets and is considering overhauling the structure of the oil and gas major in one of the biggest shake-ups in its 111-year history.  ,The 49-year-old Irishman plans to adopt broader carbon emissions reduction goals that will likely include emissions from fuels and products sold to customers rather than just the far lower emissions from BP's own operations, according to four sources with knowledge of internal discussions with the new CEO.  ,The aim is to catch up with, and possibly outdo, rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell (,) and Repsol (,) as investor pressure over climate change mounts, said the sources who declined to be named as the plans have not yet been made public.  ,More stringent climate targets could lead to London-based BP (,) selling its most carbon-intensive businesses such as oil and gas fields in Angola and Canada, they added. ,As part of the climate push, Looney is also looking at a broad reorganization of the company aimed at cutting costs, with one idea being explored to merge parts of the upstream oil and gas production division with refining and petrochemical operations, said five sources. ,The new CEO and his team of close advisers have held an intensive series of closed-door meetings in recent weeks to outline the new strategy, according to three of the sources.  ,They said he would outline his ""ambitions"" for the company in a speech on Feb. 12, a week after he takes over from Bob Dudley.  ,It is unclear if Looney has decided to adopt any structural changes at this stage.  ,A BP spokesman declined to comment. ,Any new strategy will require a fine balancing act though, and is not without risk for a company whose pioneering efforts in the early 2000s to build a large renewables business, branded ""Beyond Petroleum"", ended with huge losses.      ,BP will have to rely on revenue from an expanding oil and gas business to fund its green ambitions while maintaining the generous dividends that keep investors on board.  ,Some industry experts say that business model may not be sustainable in a low-carbon future. They also point out that BP's emissions are rising, as its oil and gas exploration and production activity expands, while it spends just a fraction of its investment pot on renewables and low-carbon technologies. ,""Looney is coming in at a crucial moment for the oil sector,"" said Morgan Stanley's global oil analyst Martijn Rats. ,""Over the next decade, companies like BP will need to maintain supply of oil and gas, for which demand is continuing to grow. That will require ongoing investment. At the same time, they will need to prepare for a decarbonised future."" ,""All the while, their investors will ask them to keep up these large dividend payments. Balancing these three demands will be the key challenge."" ,Looney, who is known for his energetic management style, wants to go beyond the carbon reduction targets that were set by Dudley in 2019 and limited to emissions from BP's own operations. ,The new targets will likely encompass, for the first time, emissions from the fuels and products sold, known as Scope 3, which account for nearly 90% of BP's total emissions, according to the sources.     ,BP's current targets are to reduce emissions from its own operations to net zero by 2025, equivalent to cutting 3.5 million tonnes of CO2 compared with 2016. It also agreed in a resolution adopted by shareholders to align its business with the 2015 Paris climate agreement goals. ,It is not clear what reduction targets the company could set for its Scope 3 emissions. The goals are however expected to be detailed at a strategy day later this year, the sources said. ,Dudley, who became CEO almost a decade ago following the Deepwater Horizon rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico that drove BP to the brink of bankruptcy, had long resisted setting Scope 3 targets, arguing the company could not control how its fuels were being used. ,While Looney receives a financially solid company, he faces fierce pressure from shareholders and activists to do more to meet U.N.-backed goals to limit global warming. In Britain in particular, BP faces regular protests and calls for boycotts.  ,Europe's top oil firms have all set carbon reduction goals of various breadth. Scope 3 targets could align BP with its most climate-progressive rivals: Repsol, which aims become a net zero-carbon company by 2050; Shell which has set out an ""ambition"" to halve Scope 3 emissions by 2050; and Total (,).  ,U.S. majors have lagged their European rivals, with Chevron setting limited reduction targets and ExxonMobil having no targets.  ,See FACTBOX on oil majors' climate goals: ,(GRAPHIC: BP's CO2 emissions - ,) ,(GRAPHIC: Going green? - ,) ,Looney, who joined BP in 1991 as a drilling engineer before rising through the ranks, is also considering overhauling the company's traditional structure, aiming to reduce costs as the outlook for oil and gas prices and consumption remains uncertain. ,The idea being explored of merging parts of its upstream and downstream operations is driven by the fact that they share similar management objectives such as safety, cost efficiency and reduction of carbon emissions, according to the sources. ,Under the proposed changes, BP would also form a unit focused on its rapidly growing retail, marketing and power businesses. These businesses are expected to be central in the energy transition as customers switch to electric vehicles and global demand for electricity is set to soar in coming decades. ,Rival Shell has already carried out a major shake-up, in 2016, establishing its integrated gas division as a separate segment following the acquisition of BG Group which sharply expanded its liquefied natural gas business (LNG).  ,France's Total created a gas, renewables and power division in 2016 as it prepared to expand it LNG and low-carbon operations, spinning off parts of its upstream operations. ,Energy companies see natural gas as key for the energy transition, replacing more polluting coal in power generation.  ,Since being announced as Dudley's successor in October, Looney has shuttled around the world, visiting staff, partners and governments in BP's main hubs, from India and Azerbaijan to Senegal. He has also met investors, consultants, bankers and environmental groups. ,""BP needs to be a willing and enthusiastic participant in the energy transition,"" said Alasdair McKinnon, manager at The Scottish Investment Trust, which holds shares in the oil major.  ,""But this needs to be balanced by the current reality of the economics of the low-carbon technologies"" that are generally less profitable than oil and gas, he added. ,The numbers underline the challenge Looney could face in meeting more ambitious emissions goals.  ,As things stand, BP's upstream emissions are set to grow by 4% between 2018 and 2025 due to higher oil and gas production in the wake of the 2018 acquisition of BHP Billiton's U.S. shale assets, HSBC said in a report, citing Wood Mackenzie data.  ,However, of the roughly $16 billion per year the company invests in its business, only about $500 million goes to renewables and low-carbon technologies.  ,BP, which made a profit of $7.4 billion in the first nine months of 2019, is also set to pay over $9 billion in dividend and share repurchases for the year.  ,""Bernard knows that doing more of the same won't win the day,"" said a senior BP official. ""He believes in oil and gas but is not blind to the consequences of using it and that it cannot last forever.""  ,(GRAPHIC: BP's recovery - ,) ",Environment,1/22/2020 7:08,Exclusive: BP's Looney goes all-in on climate goals and explores overhaul

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Storm clouds are gathering over the U.S. dollar, threatening a two-year rally in the currency that has squeezed corporate profits and angered President Donald Trump. ,Dollar bullishness in future markets stands at its lowest level in more than a year-and-a-half, according to the most recent data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission measuring the net dollar amount of bets on a rising greenback. ,Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch say the dollar triggered a so-called ""Death Cross"" on the last day of 2019. The bearish technical formation occurs when the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average, something that has been followed by a period of dollar weakness in seven out of eight instances since 1980, the bank said in a recent report. ,Easing worries over global trade and Brexit are stoking investor appetite for risk, pushing them out of safe haven assets like the dollar, said Mark McCormick, global head of foreign exchange strategy at TD Securities. ,""The global economy looks like it's healing,"" he said. ""The reduction of uncertainty will likely allow investors to take risks ... they didn't want to take before."" ,Because of the dollar's central role in the global financial system, gauging its path is important for corporations and investors. Over the last several years, the currency has withstood a number of factors that analysts believed would pull it lower, including a dovish turn by the Federal Reserve and fears of a U.S. growth slowdown.  ,The ICE Dollar Index edged 0.2% higher last year and was up around 10% from its 2018 low.

An index that measures the dollar against the currencies of the largest U.S. trading partners stands near an all-time high. ,Momtchil Pojarliev, head of currencies at BNP Asset Management, believes that trend will soon reverse. He is betting the dollar will fall against the euro, Japanese yen and Australian dollar as growth in those countries accelerates and their central banks raise interest rates while the Federal Reserve keeps them steady. That should narrow the gap in yields that has buoyed the U.S. currency.  ,A few central banks already appear to be shifting to a less dovish stance. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand surprised investors when it left rates unchanged at its November meeting, while Sweden's central bank last month became the first to raise rates back to zero from negative territory.  ,The European Central Bank, for its part, has signalled that it is done cutting rates for now. ,Richard Benson, co-chief investment officer at Millennium Global Investments in London, likes a range of emerging market currencies, including the Mexican peso and Indian rupee.

"(Reuters) - U.S. insurers are ramping up cyber-insurance rates by as much as 25% and trying to curb exposure to vulnerable customers after a surge of costly claims, industry sources said. ,The changes follow a challenging year of hackers using malicious programs, known as ransomware, to take down systems that control everything from hospital billing to manufacturing. They stop only after receiving increasingly hefty payments. ,The attacks happened less frequently in 2019, but the problem remains significant, cybersecurity experts said. ,""Ransomware is more sophisticated and dangerous than we saw in the past,"" said Adam Kujawa, director of Malwarebytes Labs. ,There were 6% fewer ransomware incidents in 2019 versus the prior year, according to Malwarebytes. However, attacks are now designed to spur deeper and more lasting technological problems, with hackers demanding bigger sums. ,The average ransom of $41,198 during the 2019 third quarter more than tripled from the first quarter, according to Coveware, which helps negotiate and facilitate the payments. ,Ransoms are becoming disproportionate to the size of targets, said Kelly Castriotta, Allianz SE (,) North American head of product development for financial lines. Hackers frequently pursue mid-size companies and other organizations that are less technologically adept, but also have less revenue to cover big ransoms. ,""You'd expect a ransomware demand that you can pay,"" Castriotta said. ,The U.S. rate increases underscore broader global ransomware problems from which no company is immune. ,Ransomware recently crippled foreign-exchange firm Travelex Ltd's [TRVLXP.UL] systems for weeks, leaving staff to serve customers with pens and paper. Hackers demanded $6 million, the BBC reported. Travelex declined to comment. ,Another attack in December paralyzed the Albany County Airport Authority's administrative computers. It had to pay $98,705.96 in Bitcoin to get the system unlocked, a spokesman told Reuters. Its insurer, Chubb Ltd (,), covered the ransom, he said. Chubb declined to comment. ,Cyber-insurance premiums started rising 5% to 25% late last year, said Robert Parisi, U.S. cyber product leader at Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc (,). ,He called the increases ""dramatic"" but said insurers have not scaled back coverage. ,Cyber policies often cover not just ransom, but data recovery, legal liabilities and negotiators fluent in hackers' native languages. Some insurers are considering changes, given the rising costs. ,Allianz is looking into price adjustments and whether ransomware should be a separate product from general cyber coverage, Castriotta said. ,Zurich Insurance Group AG (,) is more likely to underwrite firms that have added network features to prevent attacks from spreading through systems, said its chief risk officer, Peter Giger. ,Sompo International (,) is reviewing criteria for businesses that have been most vulnerable to ransomware, said Brad Gow, global cyber product leader. ,Insurers including Sompo may also lower amounts they pay for ransomware attacks against higher-risk companies or shift to coinsurance, in which policyholders would pay 20% to 30% of ransomware claims, Gow said. They might also require those policyholders to have data-backup procedures. ,Gow compared potential changes to requiring airbags or sprinkler systems. ,""We can drive a win-win by helping our clients become better protected,"" he said. ,GRAPHIC - Global threat from ransomware: ,  ",Technology News,1/22/2020 12:04,Insurers look to curb ransomware exposure as U.S. cyber rates rise
"LONDON (Reuters) - Sainsbury's (,) has picked retail and operations director Simon Roberts to succeed CEO Mike Coupe, the architect of the British supermarket group's failed bid for rival Asda who will step down in May after six years at the helm. ,Roberts' task will be to grow earnings in the face of weakening consumer demand, Brexit, and the relentless march of German-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl, which continue to win market share from Britain's big four grocers - industry leader Tesco (,), Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons (,). ,On Jan. 10, Reuters reported that Roberts was the leading internal candidate to succeed Coupe. ,Coupe, 59, has faced questions about his future since April when Britain's competition regulator blocked Sainsbury's attempt to take over Walmart-owned (,) Asda for 7.3 billion pounds ($9.5 billion) and become Britain's biggest retailer.  ,Sainsbury's shares were down 2.3% at 1135 GMT, extending losses over the last year to 25%. ,All eyes will now be on whether Roberts, 48, will adapt a strategy set out by Coupe in September that was designed to show Sainsbury's could prosper on its own. ,It focused on cost cutting, paying off debt, investment in technology and further integrating the Argos general merchandise business Sainsbury's purchased for 1.1 billion pounds in 2016. ,Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne said that, as an insider signed-up to the current strategy, Roberts was unlikely to start with a bang and a major move to significantly cut prices. ,""He will only do so if trading were to deteriorate materially.

"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Daimler (,) warned its earnings halved in 2019 and it faced further charges of up to 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion)related to diesel pollution, in the latest blow to the German luxury carmaker.   ,The profit downgrade, blamed on restructuring costs at the company's vans and mobility services divisions, is the third under new CEO Ola Kaellenius and the fifth in 19 months.  ,It comes despite record deliveries of Mercedes-Benz cars that saw the brand retain its title as the world's top-selling premium automaker last year. ,Daimler announced preliminary 2019 results ahead of their full release on Feb. 11, saying earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) were expected to tumble to 5.6 billion euros ($6.2 billion) from 11.1 billion euros in 2018.  ,""The new management proves the golden rule that one profit warning never comes alone,"" Evercore ISI analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said in a research note.  ,""What's truly remarkable is the fact that CEO Ola Kaellenius hasn't taken more action with respect to his divisional leadership teams,"" he added.  ,At 1235 GMT, Daimler shares were down 1.4% at 45.74 euros.  ,The company said earnings would be hit by 300 million euros of one-off costs for a review of its vans product portfolio. ,The vans division, which has struggled to ramp up production at its plant in the United States, saw its return on sales plunge to minus 15.9% in 2019 from 2.3% in 2018, Daimler said.  ,It also announced a 300 million euro hit from a restructuring of its Your Now mobility services business.

The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to an average of 3.65% from its peak of 4.94% in November 2018, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.  ,But the sector, which accounts for about 3.1% of gross domestic product, remains constrained by a lack of homes,  especially in the lower-priced segment of the market, because of land and labor shortages.  ,The supply squeeze and resulting reacceleration in house price inflation could slow home sales this year. ,According to the NAR, there was a 14% drop from a year earlier in sales of houses priced $100,000 and below.  ,""Still, with rising incomes, more households being formed, and low mortgage rates, demand for housing should remain robust to keep home sales activity at an elevated level – although likely little changed from 2019,"" said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide in Columbus, Ohio.  ,December's increase in existing homes sales likely means more in brokers' commissions, which suggests that housing probably contributed to GDP growth again in the fourth quarter. Residential investment rebounded in the third quarter after contracting for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the 2007-2009 recession. ,The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP to rise at a 1.8% annualized rate in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the July-September period. The government will publish its snapshot of fourth-quarter GDP next Thursday. ,There were a record-low 1.40 million previously owned homes on the market in December, down 14.6% from November and 8.5% from a year ago. As a result, the median existing house price soared 7.8% from a year ago, the most since January 2016, to $274,500 in December. House prices increased 4.8% in 2019. ,The NAR report likely exaggerates the pace of house price appreciation because of sampling methodology.  ,In a separate report on Wednesday, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) said its house price index rose a seasonally adjusted 4.9% in November from a year ago, slowing from an increase of 5.2% in October.  ,According to JPMorgan economist Daniel Silver, the FHFA measure is considered one of the more reliable house price measures ""that control for changes in the mix of sales."" ,The NAR report showed that at December's sales pace, it would take a record few 3.0 months to exhaust the current inventory, down from 3.7 months in November.  ,A six-to-seven-month supply is viewed as a healthy balance between supply and demand. ,Last month, houses for sale typically stayed on the market for 41 days, up from 38 days in November, but down from 46 days a year ago. Forty-three percent of homes sold in December were on the market for less than a month.  ,First-time buyers accounted for 31% of sales last month, slightly down from 32% in November and a year ago.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - Britain's impending decision on whether to allow Huawei [HWT.UL] to supply equipment for 5G mobile networks comes at a delicate time, with debate raging in European capitals over the security implications of reliance on Chinese technology. ,In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel's preference for applying the same rules to all equipment vendors faces growing resistance from lawmakers in her own party, who back U.S. calls to ban Huawei outright. ,Even as Britain prepares to quit the European Union, the finishing touches are still being put on a bloc-wide framework to address risks in networks that will become faster and more ubiquitous in the 5G era. ,Europe's leading telecoms operators, all Huawei customers, are lobbying against an outright ban. At the same time, they are removing the Chinese company's gear from the ""core"" of their networks. The core routes traffic and manages data and is thus more sensitive than the peripheral radio network. ,Here's an explainer on the current state of play: ,In Germany, lawmakers across party lines are challenging Merkel's pragmatism. They agree with the Donald Trump administration's arguments that Huawei can't be trusted because it is beholden to the Chinese government. Huawei denies this. ,Merkel has called for a time-out on the domestic debate ahead of a March EU summit, reinforcing a feedback loop that Brussels sources say has already slowed efforts to reach a bloc-wide consensus and delayed the 5G framework, dubbed the toolbox. ,Concerns expressed by Germany's powerful car industry that a Huawei ban could provoke trade retaliation from China - its largest export market - have influenced the thinking of Merkel and senior aides. ,Operators Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone and Telefonica are all Huawei clients. They warn that replacing its kit could cost billions of euros, on top of heavy outlays for German 5G spectrum at auction last year. ,More broadly, Europe has emerged as a battleground in the technology 'Cold War' playing out between China and Washington. Huawei's European competitors, Ericsson and Nokia, would become a supplier duopoly should the Chinese company be shut out. ,Huawei leads the global telecoms equipment market with a 28% share, according to U.S. consultancy Dell'Oro. Nokia was second on 16% and Ericsson third with 13%. Its share is higher in Europe and it is banned in the United States. ,The toolbox will create a framework to analyze and address network security issues, sources say. It will be able to make recommendations only because EU rules stipulate that security policy is a matter for national governments. ,The critical factor will be whether the toolbox explicitly differentiates between vendors deemed trustworthy and those where closer scrutiny and mitigating steps are required. ,There would be no up-front bans, but European Commissioner Thierry Breton, of France, has made it clear - in a coded message to Huawei - that the EU will assert its status as a sovereign space when it comes to telecoms networks. ,In France, market leader Orange, which is partly state owned, does not use Huawei for its domestic network. It does, however, rely on Huawei in Spain and Poland. ,Rivals Bouygues Telecom and Altice Europe's SFR are both Huawei customers, which raises potential uncertainty as France prepares to sell 5G spectrum early this year. ,Across the EU, no government has yet imposed an outright ban on Huawei. Attitudes range from welcoming to skeptical, reflecting diverging risk perceptions and attitudes towards Washington and Beijing. ,At the friendly end of the spectrum, there has been scant debate in Spain about any risks that Huawei might pose. Hungary has welcomed Huawei, saying it sees no evidence to support U.S. claims about security risks. Austria wants to coordinate with its European partners. ,Among the skeptics, the Czech Republic's cyber-security watchdog has issued a warning to all critical network companies, identifying risks of equipment from Chinese vendors Huawei and the smaller ZTE. ,Elsewhere, the Netherlands and Italy have talked about retroactive mechanisms for removing Chinese equipment should it be found wanting. Poland might impose stricter security requirements on elements of the network core that route traffic and handle sensitive information. ,Taken as a whole, Europe appears to lack the appetite for outright bans, and any consensus reached on a standards-based toolbox would represent a big win for Huawei. That would not, however, eliminate the risk that it is kicked out of individual markets at a later stage.

"PHILADELPHIA/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Third-generation Philadelphia oil refinery worker Lee Murray wore his late father's hard hat every day of the 25 years he spent there. ,A colleague gave it to him on his first day on the job, only months after the older Murray died, an act emblematic of the tight bond workers forged at the East Coast's oldest and largest oil refinery.  ,""I wanted to follow in my father's footsteps. Plus, it was one of the higher-paying jobs in the area with just a high school diploma,"" said Murray, 54, who was a unit operator. ,The hard hat now sits on a shelf, and Murray has moved from his roots a short drive from the refinery complex for work more than 300 miles (480 km) away, near Pittsburgh.  ,He, along with more than 1,000 coworkers, was thrust into a shrinking East Coast refining market after refiner Philadelphia Energy Solutions shut down following a colossal fire on June 21. Those workers accounted for about half of Pennsylvania's roughly 2,000 oil refining jobs, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows. ,The massive complex, located less than three miles (4.8 km) from downtown Philadelphia, is empty but for a handful of caretakers watching over the site. The complex is now slated to be sold to Chicago-based Hilco Redevelopment Partners for $240 million, but the chances that it reopens as a refinery are slim. ,While the U.S. economy has been growing steadily for several years, oil refining employment has slipped as automation and the shuttering of plants has bit into the industry. Refining jobs are down by nearly 8% nationwide since 2009, according to BLS figures.  ,The U.S. Gulf Coast is the one region that has seen a surge in oil industry employment, presenting PES workers with the difficult choice of staying local for jobs that pay less, or moving hundreds of miles away. Workers who have stayed in Philadelphia have left the industry or dipped into retirement savings to pay bills while looking for work. ,""It's a tough industry to be in unless you're in Houston and willing to live down there,"" said Rich Francis, 28, a former PES gasoline trader. His wife requires continued medical care for a kidney condition, which had been covered by company health insurance. He ended up leaving the industry to remain near family, who can help during emergency hospital visits.  ,The process of finding a job has been worsened by the terms of PES layoffs that cut off health benefits two months after the fire.  ,PES liquidated its group medical insurance plan under a provision allowed for companies in bankruptcy to save costs. That blocked dismissed workers from temporary health coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA), according to a document seen by Reuters. ,The lack of health insurance has made the job search more urgent for PES's unionized workforce, whose average age was in the 50s, according to a 2016 study by the United Steelworkers' local. ,""It was really a kick in the teeth,"" said Mike Gioquindo, 56, who was laid off after 13 years at PES, leaving his family without healthcare coverage for several months. He is now receiving benefits from his new job in public transportation, but took a 30% to 40% pay cut. ,The 335,000-barrel-per-day plant was the third major East Coast refinery to close since 2008. Crude processing capacity in the region has dropped by 50% in the last 10 years to roughly 1.5 million bpd, according to iirenergy.com data. ,(Graphic: U.S. East Coast refining capacity plummets - ,) ,Ryan O'Callaghan, the former local union head at PES, who worked there for 14 years, dropped his daughter off at her first day at a new college the day the refinery closed. ,O'Callaghan is looking to shift careers to stay near his family.  ,""It's like being in the twilight zone,"" he said.

Tax reform led to profit growth, and deregulation improved confidence, but the U.S. Federal Reserve deserves most of the credit.  ,Q - Do you expect this rally to continue? ,A - (We are) cautiously optimistic. It is an election year, there will be major political pressure on the Fed to stay lenient.  ,But we haven't had a 10% correction in 29 months, so it's likely that we could have one. (It's) long overdue.   ,Tech (valuations are at) dangerous levels. And there appears to be an earnings recession coming.  ,This is not 1999, but it could be (like) 2003 where an economic slowdown creates (price-to-earnings ratio) multiple compression. The historical models have been disrupted by modern monetary theory. They are still going to be accurate, just delayed.  ,Q - Where is Skybridge allocating money to this year? How has that changed from last year? ,A - In the last three months, we've been shifting more into macro strategies and picked up a bit of long bias. We believe that momentum in the market is still there as a result of the Fed moves.  ,Q -  Who do you think would be the best candidate to beat President Trump in this year's election?  ,A - Mike Bloomberg - with his money, operational forces, and ground game - could probably beat Trump. Bernie (Sanders) or Elizabeth (Warren) would get demolished.  ,Trump is likely to get re-elected. The one person who could defeat him would be Trump.  ,We are 300 days out from the election.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Real estate developer Hilco Redevelopment Partners has entered into a $240 million agreement to purchase the Philadelphia Energy Solutions (PES) oil refinery, which was the largest and oldest on the East Coast, according to court documents on Wednesday. ,Chicago-based Hilco submitted the winning bid, which includes an escrow amount of $30 million, in an auction last week for the Philadelphia site, documents filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware show. ,The sale still needs to be approved by the bankruptcy court, and Los Angeles-based developer Industrial Realty Group, LLC, was selected as the backup bidder, the documents show. ,The plan is scheduled to be submitted to the court for approval on Feb. 6, and PES can withdraw the sale plan at any time before then. ,The refiner filed for bankruptcy in July last year and put its 335,000-barrel-per-day plant up for sale a month after a fire and explosions destroyed part of the refinery. ,Hilco, which has acquired 5,000 acres (2,023 hectares) in North America, specializes in redeveloping obsolete industrial sites, dimming the prospect that the PES complex will be resurrected as an oil refinery. ,Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said in a statement the city is optimistic Hilco will develop the more than 1,300-acre site in a way that is more environmentally friendly and contributes to the regional economy, but it expects challenges and years of work ahead. ,""We welcome the selection of Hilco Redevelopment Partners as the winning bidder for the refinery site,"" Kenney said. ,City officials met with bidders during last week's auction and were briefed on the track records of the various parties, but they were not given specific details of the proposals.  ,Hilco did not respond to requests for comment on its plans for the South Philadelphia site, which has been used to store and process hydrocarbons for about 150 years.  ,However, a stakeholder who was briefed by Hilco representatives in the days prior to the auction said the company intended to use part of the site for light industrial purposes, including storage.  ,A sale to a real estate developer, either Hilco or IRG, does not preclude former bidders from leasing space on the site, according to two sources familiar with other proposals for PES.  ,More than a dozen groups showed initial interest in buying  PES, but only one publicly stated intentions to revive the site as an oil refinery at full capacity.  ,That group, led by former PES Chief Executive Officer Phil Rinaldi, was not a finalist.

"LISBON (Reuters) - Angola's billionaire former first daughter, Isabel dos Santos, has decided to sell her stake in Portuguese bank Eurobic, the small lender said on Wednesday. ,It made the announcement soon after Portuguese news agency Lusa reported that Angolan prosecutors had named dos Santos as a formal suspect over alleged mismanagement and misappropriation of funds while she was chairwoman of state oil firm Sonangol. ,Lusa quoted Angola's attorney general, Helder Pitta Gros, as telling a news conference in the Angolan capital Luanda that dos Santos had not directly shown any interest in collaborating with Angolan authorities.  ,Dos Santos, who was chairwoman of Sonangol from June 2016 to November 2017 and amassed her fortune during her father Jose Eduardo dos Santos' decades-long presidency, could not immediately be reached for comment but has denied wrongdoing. ,Portuguese newspaper Expresso said others linked to dos Santos were also named as formal suspects including Mario Leite da Silva, chairman of Banco de Fomento Angola. Silva could not immediately be reached for comment. ,In Portugal, dos Santos holds significant stakes in several major firms including NOS and oil firm Galp Energia. ,A spokeswoman for Portugal's public prosecutors office confirmed to Reuters that Angola's Pitta Gros and Portugal's attorney general Lucilia Gago will meet in Lisbon on Thursday. She did not say what they will discuss. ,Isabel dos Santos is Eurobic's main shareholder but the bank said she had decided to withdraw from the bank's shareholding structure and sell her stake.  ,In a statement sent to Reuters, Eurobic said the selling process of the 42.5% stake had already started and dos Santos' decision was ""final"".  ,It said her exit would take place ""as soon as possible"", and that Bank of Portugal, the central bank, had been informed of the decision.  ,Hundreds of thousands of files about dos Santos that were obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) were released by several news organizations on Sunday.   ,The media reports focused on alleged financial schemes used by dos Santos to build her business empire, including transfers between Angola and Dubai. ,On Monday, Bank of Portugal said in a statement it had asked Eurobic about transfers between Angola and Dubai and Portugal's prosecutor's office said it would investigate the media reports. ,Dos Santos said on Sunday that allegations made against her were ""completely unfounded"". ,Angolan authorities froze dos Santos' assets in the African country in late December following allegations by prosecutors that she and her husband Sindika Dokolo had steered payments of more than $1 billion from state companies Sonangol and Sodiam to firms in which they held stakes.

"VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou returned to a Vancouver courtroom on Wednesday where Canadian prosecutors defended a U.S. extradition request, saying Meng's alleged bank fraud is the heart of the case that has strained relations between Ottawa and Beijing. ,Canadian prosecutors have told the British Columbia Supreme Court that Meng was arrested on charges of bank fraud, which is a crime in both countries, and not because of U.S. allegations she violated U.S. sanctions against Iran. ,Over three days of hearings, Meng's legal team argued that ""double criminality"" is at the heart of the U.S. extradition request. ,When ending its arguments on Tuesday, the defense told the judge that the case is ""unique"" because ""the risk of economic deprivation arises solely from the operation of a foreign criminal law for which no corresponding Canadian…law exists."" ,The United States has charged Meng with bank fraud, and accused her of misleading HSBC Holdings Plc about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's [HWT.UL] business in Iran. ,""Lying to a bank in order to get banking services that creates a risk of economic prejudice is fraud. Fraud not sanctions violations is at the heart of this case,"" Canadian prosecutor Robert Frater told the court in his opening remark on Wednesday. ,He said even when considering the foreign legal context of the U.S. sanctions against Iran, the case for fraud can still be made. ,Unlike the defense which encouraged the judge to consider the importance of Canada's independence and absence of sanctions against Iran, the prosecutors say the judge should think independently of that. ,""Your job is not to stand up for Canadian sovereignty ... not to look at jurisdictional issues,"" Frater said. ""That tool is a matter for the executive .... you have a role that is described by statute"" he added. ,Court proceedings show the United States issued the arrest warrant, which Canada acted on in December 2018, because it believes Meng covered up attempts by Huawei-linked companies to sell equipment to Iran, breaking U.S. sanctions against the country. ,In their arguments on Wednesday, Canadian prosecutors cited Reuters stories in 2012 and 2013 about Meng, Huawei and a company called Skycom Tech Co Ltd that are cited in her indictment. ,The articles reported Skycom had offered to sell at least 1.3 million euros worth of embargoed Hewlett-Packard computer equipment to Iran's largest mobile-phone operator in 2010. ,Reuters also reported numerous financial and personnel links between Huawei and Skycom, including that Meng had served on Skycom's board of directors between February 2008 and April 2009. ,The indictment alleges that HSBC and other banks in part relied on Huawei's false statements – that it had not violated sanctions on Iran and that Skycom was a local partner – to continue doing business with Huawei. The Chinese company has denied any wrongdoing. ,The hearing will resume Thursday. ,Meng, the daughter of Huawei's billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei, remains free on bail in Canada, and has been living in a mansion in Vancouver's exclusive Shaughnessy neighborhood. ,On Wednesday, Meng sat beside her translator, behind her lawyers, pouring over documents with a pen in hand. The hearing is taking place in downtown Vancouver, in a specialized high security courtroom, with bulletproof glass separating the public gallery from the body of the courtroom. ,She has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition in part because her alleged conduct was not illegal in Canada, an argument known legally as ""double criminality."" ,Unlike the United States, Canada did not have sanctions against Iran at the time Canadian officials authorized commencing with the extradition, her lawyers have said. ,""The fact that Canada may have a different sanctions against Iran than the U.S. should not distract the court from the necessary inquiry into the essence of the conduct for double criminality purposes. Deceit and risk of loss are at the heart of the conduct,"" Canadian prosecutors have said in previous court submissions. ,On Monday, defense lawyer Richard Peck told the court that in a typical case, double criminality is not contentious. ""This case however is founded on an allegation of breach of U.S. sanctions, sanctions which Canada has expressly repudiated,"" he said. ""Sanctions drive this case,"" Peck said. ,Meng's legal team is currently only scheduled to call evidence in the last week of April, and a second phase of the trial, focusing on abuse of process and whether Canadian officials followed the law while arresting Meng, is set to begin in June. Closing arguments are expected in the last week of September and first week of October. ,Legal experts have said it could be years before a final decision is reached in the case, since Canada's justice system allows many decisions to be appealed.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump vowed to rip up international trade deals and rebalance America's global trade relationships. ,Three years into his presidency, he has done just that, using a slew of tariffs, threats, and bilateral talks to shake up relations with nearly every major U.S. trading partner.  ,Graphic: United States top trade partners , ,With a Phase 1 trade deal in hand with China, and a revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) complete at home, Trump is now turning his attention to Europe, post-Brexit Britain, and India.  ,Here's what's likely to happen next:  ,Washington and the European Union remain at odds over aircraft subsidies, trade barriers, and plans by European countries to impose taxes on digital services. ,Trump this week renewed threats to impose ""Section 232"" tariffs of up to 25% on auto imports from the EU, even though he missed a November deadline set by U.S. law to decide on the tariffs.   ,The EU will respond to any additional tariffs with duties of its own, Germany's ambassador to the United States, Emily Haber, said on Wednesday. ,France on Monday agreed to suspend a 3% digital tax on U.S. tech companies in exchange for Washington holding off on a threat to impose tariffs of up to 100% on a $2.4 billion list of French imports, a French diplomatic source said. ,At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Italy and Britain will also face tariffs if they impose digital taxes.  ,Washington has already imposed a 25% tariff on European wines and other goods, and a 10% tariff on aircraft, and threatened to raise those tariffs and expand the list of affected products if the subsidy issue is not resolved. ,Trump has been promising a ""massive"" new trade deal with the U.K., the United States' seventh-largest trading partner, since British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's election win in December, but a rift opened between the two countries this week.  ,After Mnuchin and Trump both threatened to put tariffs on imports from Britain if it proceeds with a planned digital tax, Britain's finance minister Sajid Javid said it would go ahead with the tax in April anyway. ,Javid also said at Davos that a new trade deal with the EU was Britain's ""first priority"" ahead of a deal with the United States.   ,Trump is expected to sign into law in coming weeks  legislation that will implement the new United States-Mexico-Canada (USMCA) trade agreement. ,Mexico has already ratified the deal, which replaces the 26-year-old NAFTA, and Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is pushing for the Canadian Parliament to ratify it as quickly as possible. His Conservative opposition wants more time to study the agreement.  ,The United States eliminated India's special trade status under the Generalized System of Preferences in June, affecting some $5.6 billion worth of Indian exports to the United States, amid a dispute over India's new digital trade restrictions.  ,Both governments had hoped to hammer out a limited trade deal in September, but negotiations fell apart over tariffs on U.S. farm products and approval schedules for Indian pharmaceuticals.  ,Discussions have heated up again ahead of Trump's expected visit to India in February. ,Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in September signed a limited trade deal that cuts tariffs on U.S. farm goods, Japanese machine tools and other products, deferring a threat of higher U.S. car duties. ,The two countries are due to tackle the automotive issue in a second round of negotiations expected to start in April.  ,The United States and China are expected to start talks on thorny issues such as Chinese subsidies as part of a Phase 2 trade deal, after Washington agreed in December to roll back some tariffs in exchange for China's pledge to buy $200 billion more in U.S. goods and services over the next two years. ,Trade experts are skeptical that any agreement will occur before the U.S. presidential election in November.

"BENGALURU (Reuters) - The initial trade deal between Washington and Beijing is unlikely to provide a significant boost to the U.S. economy and will only reduce the downside risk or at best help activity moderately, a Reuters poll showed. ,While financial markets were optimistic in the run-up to and after the trade agreement - with U.S. stocks hitting all-time highs last week - the growth and inflation outlook in the latest poll was little changed from the previous few months. ,The Jan. 16-22 Reuters poll of over 100 economists - taken as business leaders gathered at the World Economic Forum in Davos to be greeted by the IMF cutting its global growth forecasts again - showed a significant pickup in the U.S. economy was not on the cards. ,""The recent Phase 1 deal between the U.S. and China suggests decreasing odds of an escalation to a full-blown trade war. However, the deal so far is not comprehensive enough to significantly boost economic momentum,"" said Janwillem Acket, chief economist at Julius Baer. ,That was also clear from predictions for the Federal Reserve to remain on the sidelines this year and on expectations the next likely move would be a cut rather than a hike. ,""It is almost a one-way bet on the Fed right now, that either they are on hold or they are easing this year. I mean there is virtually no chance of tightening,"" said Jim O'Sullivan, chief U.S. macro strategist at TD Securities. ,Reuters polls over the past couple of years have repeatedly pointed to the U.S.-China trade war as the prominent downside risk for the American economy and warned it would bring the next recession closer. ,Now, despite a signed trade agreement, albeit a partial one, the chances of a U.S. recession were similar to predictions in recent months - around 20-25% in the next 12 months and about 30-35% in the next two years. ,""Recession odds, which we peg at roughly one-in-four in 2020, will wax and wane with developments on the trade war front,"" said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO. ,""While recent progress is encouraging, we remain skeptical that a broad accord can be reached this year as complex issues, such as state industry subsidies and forced technology transfers, still need to be resolved."" ,All 53 respondents polled said the latest deal would either ""reduce the downside risk to the U.S. economy"" or ""help U.S. economic growth moderately."" Not a single economist said it would ""significantly boost growth.""   ,Reuters poll graphic on the U.S. economic outlook , ,The U.S. economy will coast with annualized growth expected to have barely moved from the latest reported rate of 2.1% at the end of the forecast horizon - the second quarter of 2021. ,""The growth slowdown has probably troughed, but we do not anticipate a V-shaped recovery,"" noted Kevin Loane, senior economist at Fathom Consulting. ,While the schism in forecasters' views was clear, with 28 respondents saying the risks to their growth forecasts were skewed more to the upside and 22 seeing downside risks, most economists agreed any significant boost was unlikely. ,That was largely attributed to several other events which could prove disrupting - including a period of uncertainty in the lead-up to the U.S. presidential election in November. ,""Our views for 2020 are upbeat but cautious. A rebound from last year's global manufacturing and trade slump is likely, but businesses will be hesitant to invest amid a host of ongoing uncertainties,"" said James Sweeney, chief economist at Credit Suisse. ,With little change expected in the inflation outlook compared to recent months, all 105 economists polled forecast the Fed would keep rates unchanged at 1.50-1.75% when it meets Jan. 28-29. ,The Fed was forecast to extend that pause through to the end of 2021 at least, with the probability of a rate cut this year seen at 30%. ,While there was a clear sense of near-term optimism among economists compared with last year, nearly 75% of respondents forecast growth to be below the latest reported rate of 2.1% by mid-2021, up from around 60% in December. ,""The (trade) deal may encourage some business investment in the near-term, but the deal is only a temporary and unstable equilibrium. It is very likely to break down, and that would undermine confidence again. So any boost to economic growth will be short-lived,"" said Philip Marey, senior U.S. strategist at Rabobank. ,Reuters poll graphic on U.S. recession probability , ",Business News,1/23/2020 0:14,"U.S. economy to coast, no big boost expected from trade deal: Reuters poll"
"KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's top sugar refiner said it will increase purchases of the commodity from India, which according to two sources is part of efforts to placate New Delhi amid an ongoing spat over palm oil imports. ,MSM Malaysia Holdings Berhad (,) will buy 130,000 tonnes of raw sugar from India worth 200 million ringgit ($49.20 million) in the first quarter, the company told Reuters. It bought around 88,000 tonnes of raw sugar from India in 2019. ,MSM is the sugar refining arm of the world's largest palm oil producer, FGV Holdings (,), which is an unit of Malaysian state-owned Federal Land Development Authority or Felda.  ,The company did not cite the palm oil dispute as a reason for the increase in purchases. ,But the two sources, who are familiar with discussions between the company and the government on the purchase, said it was a bid to appease India, which has been urging Malaysia to reduce the trade deficit between the countries.  ,India, the world's largest edible oil buyer, this month effectively halted Malaysian palm oil imports apparently in retaliation to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's  comments criticising New Delhi over its policy on Kashmir. ,Malaysia has said it will look to other markets to sell more palm oil but that may not be easy as India has been the biggest buyer of Malaysian palm oil for the past five years, purchasing 4.4 million tonnes in 2019. ,Malaysia's exports to India were worth $10.8 billion in the fiscal year that ended on March 31, while imports totalled $6.4 billion. ,Malaysia imported a total of 1.95 million tonnes of raw sugar in 2019, according to data from the International Sugar Organization on Refinitiv Eikon.

"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - A number of Chinese listed companies - ranging from biotech firms, drugmakers, mask producers and thermometer manufacturers - announced efforts in response to a national call to fight the outbreak of the Wuhan coronavirus. ,The new, flu-like virus, first discovered in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, has killed 17 and infected nearly 600 people. Cases have been detected in other major population centers, including Beijing and Shanghai, as well as overseas, triggering a public scramble for face masks and flu medicines.  ,Chinese President Xi Jinping has ordered all-out prevention and control efforts to fight the new virus, and urged governments at all levels to make people's safety and health a top priority. ,Tianjin TEDA Co said in an exchange filing on Thursday that its subsidiary, TEDA Filters, is stepping up production of filtration materials used in facial masks to meet surging demand. ,Biotech firm Xilong Scientific Co said late on Wednesday that it has developed diagnostic devices for the new virus and will send the products to disease control centers in some parts of China. ,Wuhan Guide Infrared Co told the official China Securities Journal that the company has donated 4 million yuan worth of infrared thermometer devices to the government of Hubei, the province where Wuhan is located. ,Shares in TEDA, Xilong Scientific and Guide Infrared have jumped roughly 40%, 24%, and 9% this week, respectively.

"(Reuters) - Airlines and passengers are on guard against a new flu-like virus that originated in Wuhan, China. ,Here's an explainer on the airline industry's response to the outbreak so far and its potential financial exposure compared to SARS in 2003, which killed nearly 800 people: ,The biggest concern is a sharp drop in travel demand if the virus becomes a pandemic. ,During the height of the SARS outbreak in April 2003, passenger demand in Asia plunged 45%, according to the International Air Transport Association (IATA).  ,Cathay cut nearly 40% of its flights and reported a financial loss, as did Singapore Airlines Ltd, Japan Airlines Co Ltd and ANA Holdings Inc. ,The industry is now more reliant on Chinese travelers. ,For example, in Australia, Chinese travelers account for more than 15% of international arrivals, up from just 4% in 2003, according to Moody's ratings service. ,Those travelers, who arrive mostly via mainland carriers, often take domestic flights once they arrive in Australia, pointing to the potential for knock on effects for the likes of local airline Qantas Airways Ltd if there is a fall in travel demand. ,Since 2003, the number of annual air passengers has more than doubled, with China growing to become the world's largest outbound travel market. ,In 2003, 6.8 million passengers from China traveled on international flights, and that number has grown by close to 10 times to 63.7 million in 2018, according to data from the country's aviation authority. ,Global airline industry revenues more than doubled to $838 billion in 2019 from just $322 billion in 2003, according to IATA data. ,""Whether only one secondary market, an entire country or the wider region is impacted is obviously unpredictable and outside of the industry's control,"" said Brendan Sobie, an independent aviation analyst in Singapore. ,Many airlines, including Korean Air Lines, Singapore Airlines' budget carrier Scoot, Taiwan's China Airlines Ltd and Japan's ANA, announced they were cancelling flights in and out of Wuhan after authorities announced a lockdown. ,South Korean budget carrier T'way Air earlier this week postponed the scheduled launch of a new route to the city. ,Flight tracking website FlightRadar24 showed that as of 0600 GMT on Thursday, 184 Wuhan flights, or 60% of the departures listed for the day, had been canceled.  ,Wuhan's Tianhe airport serves around 2% of China's total air traffic and mainly serves domestic routes. Broker Jefferies estimated 88.8% of overall flights are domestic, with China Southern Airlines Co Ltd holding the largest market share at 30%. ,Hanatour Service Inc, South Korea's largest travel agency, said that cancellations of trips to China increased about 20% this week compared to same period last year. The figure includes postponements and switches to other destinations, a company official said. ,Rajeev Kale, country head for Thomas Cook India's holidays division, said some customers were raising concerns about traveling to China. ""Most of our customers are adopting a wait and watch approach to see further developments,"" he said. ,Philippine Airlines, Garuda Indonesia and Japan Airlines said there was no slowdown in bookings to and from China yet, while low-cost Filipino carrier Cebu Pacific said some passengers had expressed concerns about whether it was safe to fly but had not canceled bookings.

"LONDON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Boeing Co's (,) new chief executive has sent the aerospace giant back to the drawing board on proposals for a new mid-market aircraft, effectively shelving in their current form plans worth $15 billion-$20 billion that had been overtaken by the 737 MAX crisis.  ,A decision on whether to launch a New Midsize Airplane (NMA)  seating 220-270 passengers, which seemed imminent barely a year ago, had already been postponed as Boeing gave all its attention to the grounding of the smaller 737 MAX after two fatal crashes. ,But days after taking the helm with a mandate to lift Boeing out of its 10-month-old reputational crisis, Chief Executive Dave Calhoun said the competitive playing field had changed. ,""Since the first clean sheet of paper was taken to it, things have changed a bit ... the competitive playing field is a little different,"" he told journalists on a conference call on Wednesday. ,""We're going to start with a clean sheet of paper again; I'm looking forward to that,"" Calhoun said.   ,He also spoke of a fresh approach to the market. ,A Boeing spokesman said Calhoun had ordered up a new study on what kind of aircraft was needed. New aircraft typically take 6-7 years or more to bring to market once a decision is made, though Boeing aims to shorten that in part through digital technology and new business models designed around the NMA. ,Calhoun ""has asked the team to do an assessment of the future market and what kind of airplane is needed to meet the future market,"" spokesman Gordon Johndroe said. ,Noting that the original assessments on the NMA were made about two and a half years ago, he said the new study would ""build upon what has been learned ... in design and production.""  ,In further evidence of a change of pace, people familiar with the matter said a meeting between Boeing and a major potential supplier, originally scheduled for next week, had been abruptly canceled with no new date set.   ,That contrasts with the approach just weeks ago when Boeing was still presenting new details of the NMA to some airlines, including a working logo - ""theNMA"" - and details of an ""advanced composite"" structure, according to a slide seen by Reuters. ,The NMA had been designed to address a slender gap between single-aisle workhorse jets like the 737 MAX and long-haul wide-body jets like the 787.  ,But most of the effort revolved around a new production system designed not only to support the NMA but to lay the groundwork for the next single-aisle aircraft after the 737 MAX. ,Calhoun said he expected the MAX, whose return to service was delayed again earlier this week, to resume its previous place in the market and remain in service for a generation. ,Traditionally toe-to toe-with Europe's Airbus SE (,), Boeing has fallen behind in sales for the largest category of single-aisle planes, such as the 200-240-seat Airbus A321neo, which overlaps with the niche being targeted by the NMA. ,By delaying a decision on the NMA, Boeing already risked losing the sweetest part of the market, especially after Airbus seized contracts with two major U.S. airlines, analysts said. ,Analysts have also questioned whether Boeing, facing costs equivalent to a new program to repair the MAX crisis, as well as delays on its large new 777X jet whose maiden flight is set for Friday, would have appetite for such a costly project now.

"SYDNEY/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Australia's Westpac Banking Corp (,) named a former Barclays (,) boss as chairman on Thursday, entrusting veteran banker John McFarlane with the task of steering it through the country's biggest money-laundering scandal. ,The bank, Australia's second largest by market capitalization, said the 72-year-old would become a non executive director in February before taking the chairman's role in April. ,McFarlane stepped down as chairman of Barclays in May after four years. Previously he had chaired British insurer Aviva (,) which followed nine years as chief executive (CEO) of Westpac rival Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (,)  (ANZ). ,Scottish-born McFarlane takes over just two months after Westpac's top two executives stepped down following charges by the regulator for breaching of anti-money laundering laws which potentially facilitated child exploitation.  ,Westpac's current troubles are part of wider ructions in the Australian banking industry. Two of the top four banks that dominate the domestic market have lost their leaders in the wake of damaging revelations from a government-backed inquiry into misconduct in the industry. ,McFarlane's appointment, however, failed to boost the bank's shares on Thursday as investors said the prospect of a huge fine - estimated by analysts to be up to A$1 billion - for the anti-money laundering breaches continued to weigh on the bank's earnings prospects. ,Westpac shares closed at $A25.08, down 0.24% while the broader benchmark S&P/ASX200  lost 0.6%. ,""I was surprised to see the stock was down. I thought there would have been a better reaction,"" said Matt Haupt, portfolio manager at Wilson Asset Management, which owns Westpac shares. ,""I think some investors are still worried about the size of the fine and what will come out of the Austrac investigations."" ,Westpac's chief financial officer Peter King, who had flagged his retirement, is currently serving as Westpac's interim chief executive. ,McFarlane has been a hands-on chairman in previous roles, sparking speculation he may not rush to appoint a new permanent CEO. ,""He will shake up the executive ranks, and he won't hurry in appointing a CEO, he will back his own ability to be an executive chairman,"" said Matthew Wilson, banking analyst at Evans and Partners.  ,In Britain McFarlane was nicknamed ""Mack the knife"" during his chairmanship of Aviva and then Barclays. In both, he acted as executive chairman for some time.  ,In a statement earlier on Thursday, McFarlane said that the appointment of a ""world-class"" CEO could ""take time"". ,Vas Kolesnikoff, Australian head of governance adviser ISS, said Westpac needed to ensure there was a distinction between the chairman and the executive, with the search for a permanent chief executive underway. ,""You need to have somebody who is running the bank and you need to have a board that is sufficiently independent to oversee management and addressing all the issues,"" Kolesnikoff said. ,Martin Lawrence, governance analyst at Ownership Matters, a proxy advisory firm, said McFarlane came with a reputation for ""drastic change"". ,""If there needs to be hard decisions made, I don't think he is going to be afraid to make them,"" he said. ,Former Westpac chief executive Brian Hartzer left the bank after the money-laundering scandal was revealed while chairman Lindsay Maxsted also accelerated his departure from the bank's board. ,At last month's annual meeting, the lender's shareholders voted down executive pay for a second year due to investor outrage over the scandal..  ,Westpac gave no details on Thursday of McFarlane's remuneration.

But again, there's ongoing discussion on these issues."" ,Britain is expected to make a final call on how to deploy Huawei equipment in its 5G networks later this month. ,In what some have compared to the Cold War arms race, the United States is worried that 5G dominance would give any global competitor such as China an advantage Washington is not ready to accept. ,That puts Johnson on the spot with the United Kingdom's closest security ally just as he seeks to negotiate post-Brexit trade deals with both the European Union and the United States - and juggle conflicting EU and U.S. policy on Iran.  ,Britain wants a trade deal with the United States but will still impose a digital service tax on the revenue of companies such as Google, Facebook and Amazon, business minister Andrea Leadsom said on Thursday. ,Leadsom said that Britain will soon decide what role Huawei will have but there are only a limited number of alternative providers, business minister Andrea Leadsom said on Thursday. ,""Well there are other providers but they are limited, ideally there would be more providers of infrastructure similar to the work that Huawei does but the UK is looking very carefully at this issue and we will be making a final decision soon,"" Leadsom told Sky.     ,""It is an ongoing process and there are all sorts of factors to take into consideration, as you say, like the availability of other providers, like the work that Huawei has already done in the United Kingdom, so these discussions are ongoing,"" she said. ,""I share the concerns of many citizens about protecting our national security interest,"" Leadsom said.

"MEXICO CITY/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mexico is playing a risky game of hide and seek with the oil market. ,To frustrate speculators and contain an annual bill of more than $1 billion, Mexico is going to new lengths to mask its attempts to insure its revenue from oil sales against falling prices - no mean feat for a hedging program known as Wall Street's biggest oil trade.  ,Getting the hedge right is crucial for Mexico as it offers stability at a time the government is planning to boost social welfare and security spending, the economy is stagnating and the country's credit-worthiness is under intense scrutiny. ,Once an enigmatic agreement between a handful of finance industry officials and Wall Street banks, the hedge is now the most anticipated deal in the oil futures market, making it harder, and more costly, for Mexico to arrange. ,For its 2020 hedge, however, Mexico has adopted a different strategy than in previous years, according to a Wall Street source with direct knowledge of the deal. ,This time, an estimated two-thirds of the options Mexico bought in financial markets were indexed to the international Brent crude benchmark, shifting away from the Maya oil Mexico mainly produces, according to the source. ,By using such a heavily traded contract as Brent, Mexico should have been able to cut costs by getting lower quotes for its trades and to place bets more unobtrusively to avoid prices shifting ahead of its moves, market sources said.     ,But critics say the strategy creates new risks. By using international oil contracts based on a different kind of oil, the structure of the hedge may not fully reflect Mexico's export mix dominated by Maya, which is typically cheaper than Brent. ,""I would expect a divergence of prices over the long term. This pressure on Maya could move prices down faster than its hedge. This would cause a loss on the physical sale of Maya and minimal-to-possibly no benefit of the hedge,"" said Ryan Dusek, director at consulting firm Opportune LLP https://opportune.com based in Houston, who added that the trade could end up being ""worthless."" ,The Mexican finance ministry declined to comment on the structure of the hedge. ,The Wall Street source said the proportion of Maya crude hedged for 2020 was significantly lower than in previous years.  ,For the 2009 deal, for example, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley hedged 305 million barrels of crude using Maya and only 25 million with Brent, data obtained by Reuters through a freedom of information request showed. ,The Wall Street source said for 2020, Mexico had bought put options on Brent on the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) at $54-$56 a barrel and hedged Maya at $42.  ,Brent LCOc1 is trading at around $63 a barrel while Maya's official selling price for deliveries to the U.S. Gulf Coast is about $55, according to S&P Global Platts pricing data. ,The options give Mexico the right to sell oil at the predetermined price, so if the actual market price is lower, the options pay out and make up the difference - acting effectively as an insurance policy. ,But if the price of Maya, a heavy sour crude, falls faster than Brent, a light sweet crude - or Maya drops and Brent rises - Mexico could miss out on oil revenues without the hedge kicking in, analysts and market sources said. ,Mexico has had to contend with the potential divergence in Maya and Brent crude prices before but the risk is now greater as demand for heavy crudes globally is expected to slump. ,Reuters was unable to determine whether Mexico has taken additional steps to bridge any gaps between Maya and Brent. ,Mere rumors of Mexico's ""Hacienda hedge,"" which gets its name from the country's finance ministry, can shift prices ahead of its anticipated deals and the government fears participants push up premiums when they suspect Mexico is about to trade. ,""Banks have become much better at accumulating information about it,"" said Victor Gomez, a former Mexican finance ministry official involved in the hedge until 2018. ,In part due to this, the hedge's cost has increased 10-fold in peso terms since 2001, even though the number of barrels hedged has barely changed, the data obtained from the freedom of information request showed. ,Mexico spent the equivalent of $212 million to hedge 200 million barrels in 2001 but in 2016, hedging 212 million barrels cost $956 million. In 2017, Mexico stopped disclosing the number of barrels it has hedged.  ,Now, for the first time in at least 19 years, finance ministry officials have declined to reveal how much they're spending to protect 2020 revenue, saying the information would give speculators insight into their strategy and raise costs. ,""What we don't want is that they identify the moments that Mexico goes to the market, because that raises the costs of the premium,"" Gabriel Yorio, one of the main architects of the hedge under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who took office a year ago, told reporters this month. ,The cost of the hedge has also risen because the peso has declined versus the U.S. dollar and because options have become more expensive since many commodity-oriented funds, which were natural counterparties to the deal, have closed. ,Officials have also declined to say how much of the 1.73 million barrels a day it produces they're protecting, nor to what extent they're using put options or a budget stabilization fund to guarantee government revenue. ,All they have disclosed is that the 2020 hedge guarantees an average price for Maya of $49 a barrel. ,(Graphic: Mexico oil hedge - ,) ,Since 2001, Mexico has received three payouts up until the end of last year: in 2009, 2015 and 2016, the data showed. ,Nevertheless, those three payments were so large the finance ministry could argue it was still ahead - at least before including the cost of the 2020 program. ,Mexico has also taken other steps to cover its tracks. In response to further questions in Reuters' records request, Mexico's transparency institute said additional information about the hedge had been sealed for five years. ,It cited the finance ministry as saying revealing details could increase costs, affect Mexico's monetary policy and financial stability and create systemic financial risk. ,""This is part of Mexico's strategy to leave banks and oil majors in the dark about what they are buying and how much they are paying,"" said Gomez. ,Asked about specifics at a news conference on Jan. 9, Mexican official Yorio highlighted the importance of the overhaul of the crude oil pricing formulas that underpin Mexico's oil exports. ,Last year, Mexico changed the pricing formula for Maya sales to the U.S. Gulf Coast to be based 65% on U.S. West Texas Intermediate in Houston - a light sweet crude which is the most traded U.S. Gulf Coast grade - and 35% on Brent futures. ,Before, it had been derived from West Texas Sour, Dated Brent and other grades that have become less traded markets. The formula also previously included fuel oil rich in sulphur, which has been hit by new rules requiring ships to use cleaner fuel. ,Mexican officials involved in the hedge in the past said the government may be considering increasing its use of the stabilization fund to guarantee oil prices as a supplement to financial instruments. ,From the mid-2010s, Mexico started to lock in part of its target oil price with the fund to contain the costs of the options it buys from banks and major oil companies. ,For example, Mexico locked in a price of $79 for its 2015 hedge, with $76.40 guaranteed by options and the remaining $2.60 backed by the fund. In 2017, the last time the ministry released such information, $4 of its $42 hedge was covered by the fund.  ,Gomez and Julio Ruiz, another former official involved in the hedge until 2018, said Mexico was expected to expand this strategy in the coming years but cautioned it would struggle to keep enough money in the fund to hedge oil exports fully.  ,""They would have to accumulate a larger amount of resources in this fund,"" Gomez said. ,Nevertheless, those changes would do little to ease the concerns of some who believe Mexico spends too much on the hedge, said Ruiz, adding that guaranteeing oil revenue was still necessary given the pressures on Mexico and state-owned Pemex, the world's most heavily indebted oil company. ,""In congress, many will say they don't agree with how this money is spent, and that it shouldn't be spent on the oil hedging program,"" Ruiz said.  ,""But Mexico's finances would become a lot more volatile without it.""

"LONDON/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon's new government faces huge upcoming debt repayments and a currency peg at breaking point, but it may already have run out of the hard cash firepower it needs to tackle these problems. ,The heavily indebted country faces hefty bond repayments coming up in March and April, when $1.34 billion and $842 million of interest and principal respectively come due. ,Analysts expect the central bank to be able to foot the bill, for now, though some in Beirut believe a rescheduling or restructuring is preferable. ,But as policymakers cling to the currency peg and with dollar flows having dried up, the question of how much ammunition the central bank has left has become ever more pertinent. ,Some analysts calculate that the country's foreign currency reserves could be negative in real terms. ,""In a crisis, there's no definition of what's usable,"" said Nafez Zouk at Oxford Economics. ""If you have to defend the peg, what's usable and what's not usable changes, and you will have to touch the reserves held by banks at the central bank."" ,Lebanon's financial system has a complicated profile, with diaspora dollars attracted by high interest rates forming a major source of hard cash and local banks holding large amounts of external hard currency bonds. ,Officially, the country had foreign currency reserves of $31.5 billion at the end of December. The International Monetary Fund calculated that Lebanon had more than 11 months' worth of import cover - a level deemed ample by many measures. ,But how large is the war chest in reality? Morgan Stanley calculates the current level of net reserves - or gross foreign currency holdings minus banks' mandatory reserves together with the country's own holdings - at $11.5 billion as of the end of 2019. ,""Estimates of BDL's (Banque du Liban) usable reserves were wide-ranging, given the complex linkage between BDL and the domestic banks,"" Morgan Stanley strategist Jaiparan S Khurana wrote in a recent note to clients. Khurana also acknowledged that some calculations of reserves could end up with a negative number. ,The fact that the central bank owes $67 billion to commercial banks would also turn the reserves number negative, said Oxford Economic's Zouk. And even some policymakers agree. ,""In my opinion the reserve has become negative,"" outgoing economy minister Mansour Bteish said in an interview.  ,Bteish estimates the shortfall between the central bank's liabilities to commercial banks - or hard currency deposits parked by lenders at the bank - and its own reserves at around $40 billion. ,Graphic: Hot spring for Leban, ,The central bank also holds $13.9 billion of gold and $5.7 billion of government holdings of dollar bonds.  ,While selling large quantities of gold is not that easy, countries under pressure such as Venezuela have mobilized their gold stacks as collateral for swap operations to gain access to hard currency. ,Yet Zouk points out that Lebanon using its gold could be tricky as parliamentary approval is needed to do so and domestic public opinion is strongly against such a move. ,And while it is unusual for a country's central bank and lenders to hold the foreign-denominated debt of their own sovereign, this could be a mitigating factor in the big debt repayments falling due soon, some analysts said. ,Lebanon faces interest and principal payments of nearly $4.4 billion in all in 2020.  ,""Considering the foreign ownership is now 45%, the net impact on the BDL's foreign reserve position from these payments will be smaller than what the headline number would suggest,"" Morgan Stanley's Khurana said. ,While official data show that foreign currency reserves have held up better than many expected in recent months, trends in dollar flows - the grease that has kept Lebanon's financial engine running for years - are a cause for concern, said J.P.Morgan. ,""While capital controls helped keep resident FX deposits unchanged, non-resident FX deposits decreased by $2.1 billion as of end-November alone and total 2019 deposit outflows amounted to $12 billion as of end-November,"" J.P.Morgan analysts wrote in a note. ,Beirut appears to be running out of road fast, said Oxford Economics' Zouk. He calculates that Beirut will honor its upcoming debt payments while leaving capital controls in place but that it will lack new dollar inflows while having to manage a current account deficit including a 30% compression of imports and additional foreign currency leakage of $2 billion a month. ,""Add all these up, and reserves are gone by September.""

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co (,) said on Thursday that the Boeing 737 MAX grounding will continue weighing on its profits in the first quarter and warned that it will likely extend flight cancellations beyond June as the jets look set to remain parked longer than expected. ,Southwest, the world's largest 737 MAX operator, is among the airlines hardest hit by the global grounding of Boeing Co's (,) once fast-selling jet in March following two fatal crashes, forcing thousands of monthly flight cancellations. ,Dallas-based Southwest said unit costs excluding fuel and profit-sharing expenses are seen spiking between 6% and 8% in the current quarter as the company manages an operation built around more flights than it is now able to operate due to fleet constraints. ,""The outlook continues to be negatively impacted by the grounding of the MAX,"" Cowen analyst Helane Becker said. ,Shares in Southwest fell 0.7% at $53.11 in premarket trading. ,Net income declined 21% to $514 million, or $0.98 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $654 million, or $1.17 per share, a year earlier. ,The profit was below a Wall Street consensus forecast for $1.09 per share, mainly because Southwest said it treated a $124 million profit-sharing payment to employees that stemmed from a partial compensation agreement with Boeing last month as an operating expense while most analysts treated it as a one-time item. ,""I am pleased with the Boeing agreement for 2019.

However, that said, obviously outbound mergers and acquisitions (M&A) from China has gone down considerably, but other cross border M&A remains reasonably strong.   ,Q - Many of Citigroup's competitors are going down market to look for growth since there is more competition for the biggest deals but fewer of them. Why hasn't Citi followed suit?   ,A - We are not going down market because we do not believe that's the right phraseology. What we are doing is spending significant time on smaller emerging growth companies, which we believe, over time, will be winners within their sub-sectors. ,Those companies are candidates for initial public offerings, merger and acquisition (M&A) opportunities and other potential services that we can bring to bear as they grow globally.  ,Q - How has the era of ""unicorns"" changed the way Citigroup sources new clients?  ,A - The era of unicorns relates to the earlier question about covering smaller companies. The unicorn valuations help highlight companies with great potential for us to cover and are very helpful in the areas we should invest in from the people standpoint.  ,Q - In 2018, Citi's overall market share across advisory, syndicate lending and equity and debt origination rose to 5.1%, from 4.9%. How is the effort to capture more market share progressing and what are the biggest hurdles?   ,A - We continue to increase market share in 2019 slowly and carefully.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - Seven U.S. bombs from World War Two have been found in the plot of land outside Berlin where electric car pioneer Tesla (,) wants to build its first European factory, local authorities said on Thursday. ,The duds weigh about 50 kg each and explosives experts plan to defuse them in future, said a spokesman for the interior minister in the state of Brandenburg where the property is. ,Tesla has agreed to buy land in Gruenheide just outside Berlin where it wants to build a giant factory that would give its cars the ""Made in Germany"" branding. ,Tesla's local rivals are preparing to launch their own range of electric vehicles to compete with the U.S. company, whose decision to produce in Germany is sure to give BMW, Daimler's Mercedes and Volkswagen's Audi a good run for their money. ,Unexploded bombs are often found in and around German cities, where authorities evacuate residents near the site to ensure their safety while disposal experts defuse them. ,A 500 kg World War Two bomb was found in the western city of Cologne this week and similar dud was found near a main square in Berlin. ,Tesla has agreed to pay 40.91 million euros for the 300-hectare plot for its factory.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits increased less than expected last week, suggesting the labor market continues to tighten even as job growth is slowing. ,Labor market strength is underpinning consumer spending, helping to keep the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year, on track, despite a downturn in manufacturing. ,""Employers are not cutting positions outside of the normal churn of the labor market and workers are incredibly confident in their job prospects, and not taking the time to file a claim if they are laid off,"" said Maria Cosma, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.  ,Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 211,000 for the week ended Jan. 18, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims had declined for five straight weeks, resulting in the unwinding of the surge seen in early December, which was blamed on a later-than-normal Thanksgiving Day. ,Claims data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims increasing to 215,000 in the latest week.  ,The Labor Department said claims for Alabama, California, Delaware, Hawaii, Kansas, Puerto Rico and Virginia were estimated because of Monday's Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday, which left authorities with less time to compile the data. ,The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,250 to 213,250 last week, the lowest level since September. ,U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data, with investors focusing their attention elsewhere. The dollar edged up against a basket of currencies after the European Central Bank left unchanged its key interest rates and stimulus programs. U.S. Treasury prices rose, while stocks on Wall Street fell on rising worries over the coronavirus outbreak in China. ,Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of January's employment report.  ,The four-week moving average of claims dropped 12,500 between the December and January survey periods, suggesting some pickup in job growth this month. ,The economy created 145,000 jobs last month after adding a massive 256,000 positions in November. The slowdown in job growth has been blamed on a shortage of workers and ebbing demand in some industries like manufacturing, which has been hammered by trade tensions and problems at Boeing (,). ,Boeing this month suspended production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, with ripple effects down the supply chain. Boeing's biggest supplier Spirit AeroSystems Holdings (,) said early this month it planned to lay off more than 20% of the workforce at its Wichita, Kansas base.  ,Despite the low level of claims, the data have been showing layoffs in manufacturing, as well as transportation and warehousing, construction, educational service and accommodation and food services industries from late 2019 through mid-January.  ,That fits in with the Federal Reserve's Beige Book, which last week showed ""most districts cited widespread labor shortages as a factor constraining job growth,"" and ""a number of districts reported job cuts or reduced hiring among manufacturers,"" as well as ""scattered reports of job cuts in the transportation and energy sectors,"" at the tail end of 2019. ,""The jury is out on whether this signals a soft patch for the monthly payroll figures in January,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ,Despite the moderation in job gains, the labor market remains on solid footing, with the unemployment rate holding near a 50-year low of 3.5% in December and a measure of labor market slack dropping to an all-time low of 6.7%. ,Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 37,000 to 1.73 million for the week ended Jan. 11. The so-called continuing claims had surged to 1.80 million at the end of 2019, which was the highest level since April 2018. The jump was blamed on year-end volatility. ,The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims increased 2,000 to 1.76 million in the most recent week.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of Blue Cross Blue Shield insurers is investing $55 million in a venture that aims to offer cheaper prices to their members on generic drugs that currently have little or no competition, the companies said on Thursday. ,The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (BCBSA) and 18 Blue Cross Blue Shield health insurers are working with Civica Rx, a non-profit formed two years ago to try to increase competition for hospital-based generic drugs. ,The new subsidiary will focus on drugs that members can purchase via mail order or in retail pharmacies. Starting in 2022, it plans to begin selling new rivals for about 7 to 10 expensive generic medicines that currently have just one manufacturer, Civica Chairman Dan Liljenquist said. An advisory board will select the drugs. ,Civica will be able to sell the drugs at a lower price than a current manufacturer by leveraging the volume of prescriptions among its Blues plans members to guarantee discounts, Liljenquist said. The company may also manufacture drugs itself. ,Members will benefit from those lower prices based on their plan design, BCBSA strategy head Maureen Sullivan said. The lower cost to the Blues plans could translate into lower out-of-pocket spending, savings on the overall premium or potentially a lower co-pay or a co-pay waiver for patients, she said. ,About 78% of the $335 billion in annual U.S. drug spending goes to generic versions of branded drugs that have lost patent protection, according to generic industry trade group, the Association for Accessible Medicines.  ,Large generic drug manufacturers say price competition has severely crimped profits for many of their drugs, leading to industry consolidation. That has increased the number of drugs with only one manufacturer, which can result in significant price spikes on lifesaving medicines. ,Some particularly egregious recent examples of price gouging or drug shortages led the U.S. Food & Drug Administration to enact new policies to try to ease the process for approving new rival generic drugs where there are only one or two existing versions available. ,A Civica spokeswoman said that as of the beginning of this year, it was either supplying or producing a total of 18 hospital-based medicines including commonly used medicines like bacitracin, lidocaine and morphine. Generic manufacturers that currently produce them include Hikma Pharmaceuticals (,), Xellia Pharmaceuticals and Exela Pharma Sciences, she said. ,Participating Blues plans include Independence Blue Cross, Blue Shield of California and Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield among others.

"(Reuters) - Fears about the future of energy assets have led to a sell-off, but this has created ""very good opportunities"" for the Carlyle Group, its founder, David Rubenstein, said on Thursday.  ,Rubenstein, co-executive chairman of the private equity (PE) giant, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum that securing bank loans for such deals had become harder, however. ,Big investors are rewarding companies with progressive climate policies and dumping heavy polluters, as climate change gains importance on the investment agenda. ,Rubenstein said he was ""very bullish"" on renewables and added that investors entering established PE funds today can expect mid-teen percentage rates of return through over the fund life-cycle. ,Below are excerpts from the interview, conducted on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland: ,Question (Q) - You've acquired a great deal of expertise across industry segments such as energy, financial services, manufacturing. Which of these look more appealing to you from an investment point of view now and why? ,Answer (A) - Right now, energy is relatively cheap and therefore we are looking at lot of assets where there has been a sell-off in the value, in part because people are nervous about the future of carbon energy. So we still think there are very good opportunities there.  ,In renewables, there's no doubt in your lifetime - probably not mine - renewables will probably be dramatically bigger than they are today and we have an opportunity there for people to invest with us. We're very bullish on renewables right now.   ,Q - Some people see conditions in parts of the credit market (leveraged loans, BBB-rated debt) worsening. Do you feel there are risks to how PE firms fund their deals, especially in the energy space with credit spreads widening? ,A - There's no doubt that getting energy loans is more challenging than it was before. Lenders are worried about it.  ,I think the biggest issue with respect to credit is this - when we do go into a down cycle and some deals don't work out, government regulators always like to come in and say, ""What can I do to make this better or 'how can I help you this morning'"" kind of thing? ,So, I think that it's possible that some regulators may say,  the debt lending is by the private equity firms themselves, their private credit businesses and not just private equity firms, but hedge funds and so forth, it's not really regulated. ,And so, there may be a look at some point to sort of try to see whether that part of the financial services world should be regulated.  ,Q - What sort of return on capital do you see money entering PE today earning over the fund life-cycle i.e. 7-10 years? ,A - I'd say generally people should expect mid-teen rates of return through good and bad times.  ,So I would say as an average, if you go into a mature, good, well-run private equity fund - not taking undue risks - I think something like 15% net is realistic and I think it's satisfactory to investors.

"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The European Central Bank launched a broad review of its policy on Thursday that is likely to see new President Christine Lagarde redefine the ECB's main goal and how to achieve it. ,The euro zone's central bank has fallen short of its inflation target of just under 2% for years, even after launching increasingly aggressive stimulus measures under Lagarde's predecessor, Mario Draghi.  ,Lagarde said that aim will now be reviewed, along with the ECB's toolkit, how it measures price growth and how it communicates with the public.  ,""We will not leave any stone unturned and how we measure inflation is clearly something we need to look at,"" Lagarde told her second news conference as ECB president. ,How the ECB changes its formulation of price stability — currently defined as an annual inflation rate below, but close to, 2% over the medium term — will be crucial to anticipate future policy moves. ,The ECB could signal its commitment to boosting inflation by raising the goal to 2% and spelling out that it will take any undershooting just as seriously as an overshoot. ,But hawks on the policymaking Governing Council, who have long called for the ECB's money taps to be shut off, will not go down without a fight. ,Some of them favour creating a tolerance band around 2%, which would reduce pressure on the ECB to act, while others would leave the target unchanged or even cut it. ,Lagarde refrained from revealing her favoured option pending the end of the review, expected in November or December. ,An analysis on how to better incorporate housing costs, which have been rising fast in Germany and other euro zone countries, is likely to take even longer, Lagarde added. ,The ECB will also look closely at how it can incorporate the economic impact of climate change into its policy. ,This is a thorny issue that some of Lagarde's colleagues do not believe belongs in a central bank's mandate at all. ,Objections include that a climate change objective might interfere with the ECB's goal of maintaining price stability or ease pressure on governments to do their part. ,""I'm aware of all that but I'm also aware of the danger of doing nothing and I think that, you know, failing to try is already failing,"" Lagarde said. ,She added the ECB could look at whether the issuers of the bonds that it buys or accepts as collateral comply with environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) criteria. ,ECB rate-setters did not make any policy change on Thursday, simply standing by their pledge to keep buying bonds and, if needed, cut interest rates until price growth in the euro zone heads back to their goal. ,They did, however, discuss the recent improvement in the economic outlook, which has seen data stabilise and the United States and China reach a trade deal. ,Lagarde acknowledged that views differed on the Governing Council and welcomed the discussion, emphasising the diplomatic skills that her predecessor was often accused of lacking. ,""I'm not a despotic president of the Governing Council,"" Lagarde said. ""All governors have their space and time in order to share their perspective and submit their views, but at the end of the day and at the end of the process, we still have to complete the introductory statement and release a monetary policy decision."" ,The ECB is widely expected to leave its monetary policy on hold until the review is completed.  ,That would leave it adding 20 billion euros ($22.16 billion) worth of bonds to its 2.6 trillion euro portfolio every month and charging banks 0.5% on their idle cash for most of the year.   ,But Lagarde said the ECB would adhere to its current strategy until a new one is adopted, meaning policy changes could still take place in the meantime. ,""We think the ECB will cut interest rates at the end of the year when the review concludes, in order to underline its commitment to meeting the inflation target,"" said Paul Diggle, an economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments.  ,The euro , fell against the U.S. dollar after Lagarde's news conference and was last down 0.4% at $1.1046.

"GEORGETOWN (Reuters) - Guyana's government next month plans to begin a search for an oil company or trading firm to market its share of the South American country's crude, the director of the Department of Energy, Mark Bynoe, said in an interview.      ,The government is entitled to a portion of the light, sweet crude that a consortium led by Exxon Mobil Corp (,) began producing last month after making 15 discoveries in recent years. The finds are set to transform the economy of Guyana, an impoverished country of fewer than 800,000 people.     ,With no refining capacity, Georgetown last year began selling its share of crude through open-market tenders, the first one awarded to Royal Dutch Shell Plc (,) for loading the first three cargoes allocated to the government. After that, it will depend on the trading firm to sell its oil to export  markets as the state builds up capacity to do so itself, Bynoe said.     ,""We don't yet have the kind of back office support that is necessary,"" he told Reuters on Wednesday afternoon in his office, lined with books on energy and development including historian Daniel Yergin's ""The Prize.""      ,""We're moving to this simpler methodology to be able to ensure that as we build out, we are not losing value.""     ,Bynoe said the government next month expects to begin asking international oil companies (IOCs) and energy trading firms for proposals to operate as the agent.      ,But he said the selection would not necessarily be made before Guyana's March 2 elections.  ,Irfaan Ali, who is challenging President David Granger, has pledged to review the terms of oil deals signed by the current administration. He has argued that the government was not transparent in choosing Shell to lift the first cargoes.    Bynoe disputed that.  ,He said the government invited nine oil companies to present bids because crude from the Liza field was new to the market, and the government wanted to see how it performed in different refineries.  ,He declined to disclose the price included in Shell's winning bid. ,Latin American nations including Mexico and Ecuador have signed contracts with trading companies in recent years so the firms market a portion of their crude exports. Critics say that by doing so, the countries or their state-run firms can lose an opportunity to obtain better terms by dealing directly with refiners.  ,After finding more than 6 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas resources in Guyana, Exxon and its partners Hess Corp (,) and CNOOC Ltd (,) expect to produce 750,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude by 2025.  ,Several other firms - including Tullow Oil (,), Repsol SA (,) and Total SA (,) are also exploring off the coast, though none have yet made commercial finds. ,Bynoe said Guyana expects to hire a company within two months to conduct new seismic surveys in the shallow continental shelf and some in deeper waters to provide hints as to where else oil may lie.     ,That would set the stage for a new licensing round for offshore acreage around the second quarter of 2021, he said.         ,The government is also working on a new template for production-sharing agreements (PSA) that could apply to future offshore development, but Bynoe reiterated that Guyana has no plans to renegotiate the Exxon deal.      ,The opposition and outside observers have criticized the Exxon agreement, which includes a 2% royalty and 50% profit share after Exxon recovers its costs, as too generous. But the company and the government argue incentives were necessary to attract investment to a risky play.     ,Bynoe did not specify what could change with the new PSA, parts of which would need to be approved by Congress, but said Guyana's basin was a less risky play after Exxon's discovery, allowing the government to ""move from a position of greater knowledge.""      ,He added that the country expected to hire an international consulting firm to help update its petroleum legislation, which was passed in 1986, by next week at the latest.

"(Reuters) - Healthy travel demand is cushioning results for American Airlines Group Inc (,) and Southwest Airlines Co (,), the two said on Thursday, while warning they are losing customers as their Boeing 737 MAX jets remain parked in a global grounding.  ,American and Southwest, the two largest U.S. operators of Boeing Co's (,) 737 MAX aircraft that has been grounded since March following two deadly crashes, said they do not have enough aircraft to meet the demand they see in the market. ,Both airlines have canceled flights into early June as they operate slimmer fleets but said on Thursday that cancellations would likely extend into the summer or fall after Boeing signaled this week that it does not expect to win regulatory approval for the jets to fly again until mid-year. ,Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said the airline is losing 6 million to 7 million customers a year due to the 737 MAX grounding, but said he expects to ""aggressively recapture"" lost market share once the jets return. ,""There's a lot of pent-up demand for traveling on American. We're not going to be able to meet it all,"" American CEO Doug Parker told CNBC. ""It's going to unfortunately go to some of our competitors."" ,Even without the MAX, both airlines reported solid quarterly profits and pointed to strong first-quarter bookings. ,Shares of American Airlines gained 2.6% to $28.03 while Southwest shares were up 3.5% at $55.35. ,After regulators give the green light, airlines will still need a month or longer to prepare the jets and their pilots. ,For Southwest, the world's largest 737 MAX operator with nearly 10,000 pilots, the training process will take at least a couple of months more than the 30 days that it initially expected now that Boeing is recommending simulator training rather than just computer based training. ,Parker said it was too soon to see any impact from the coronavirus that has emerged from Wuhan, China, but said the carrier is working with U.S. public health officials.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co's regulator on Thursday announced it had brought civil charges against eight former executives, including former Chief Executive Officer John Stumpf, marking the first federal action against individuals for their role in the bank's three-year sales practices scandal.  ,The unprecedented enforcement action by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), which has been under pressure from lawmakers to take a tough line on the bank, is one of a long list of investigations into the San Francisco-based lender.  ,Others, including ongoing probes by the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission, could result in further individual charges. One person with knowledge of the OCC probe said it was far-reaching and that more individuals could potentially be charged in future.  ,Some of the OCC's findings also contradict Wells Fargo's 2017 board report into the scandal, and is likely to spark further questions by lawmakers and regulators about the bank's efforts to fix its cultural problems. That report largely pinned the blame on a small number of executives, in particular the bank's former retail banking head Carrie Tolstedt, but on Thursday the OCC said many members of the bank's senior leadership were culpable. ,Stumpf agreed to pay $17.5 million to settle the charges, while former human resources head Hope Hardison and Michael Loughlin, former chief risk officer, settled for $2.25 million and $1.25 million, respectively, the OCC said.  ,Stumpf, who could not immediately be reached for comment, also agreed to a lifetime ban on working for an OCC-regulated bank. He abruptly left the company in October of 2016 after a nearly a decade at the helm. ,Five other former executives refused to settle, including Tolstedt who is facing a potential $25 million civil monetary penalty, James Strother, the former general counsel, and Claudia Russ Anderson, the former community bank group risk officer, who both face $5 million fines. They and two auditing executives will fight the charges before a judge under the OCC's administrative process.  ,""Throughout her career, Ms. Tolstedt acted with the utmost integrity and concern for doing the right thing. A full and fair examination of the facts will vindicate Carrie,"" a lawyer for Tolstedt said in a statement. ,In a statement, Strother's lawyer said the former Wells Fargo executive ""acted with the utmost integrity and transparency"" and that the OCC's charges are ""false and unfounded.""  ,Russ Anderson could not immediately be reached for comment.  ,In a memo to Wells Fargo employees, CEO Charlie Scharf said the company was reviewing Thursday's filings and will determine what, if any, further action is appropriate in respect to any of the individuals who were named. The memo added that the bank would not make any remaining compensation payments that may be owed to those individuals in the meantime. ,Wells Fargo, the country's fourth largest U.S. lender, has paid out more than $4 billion in fines and penalties since the 2016 revelation that the bank's sales practices encouraged employees to open potentially millions of unauthorized bank accounts in order to hit lofty sales targets.  ,Since then, internal and external probes have uncovered issues in each of Wells Fargo's major business lines, including wealth management and the commercial bank. The fallout has also resulted in the Federal Reserve imposing an unprecedented growth restriction on Wells Fargo's balance sheet until it proves it has fixed its risk management and controls.  ,While Wells Fargo has inked multiple federal and private settlements for its sales practices, the OCC action marks the first federal action against individuals for their roles in the scandal, instead of just the institution.  ,In its complaint, the OCC said that senior bank leadership must have been aware of rampant sales misconduct, citing large numbers of employee complaints and years' worth of other evidence. For example, an internal investigation conducted by the bank in 2004 found that instances in which staff ""gamed"" the sales system to meet targets climbed 979% from 2000 to 2004. ,The number of calls to the bank's internal ethics hotline steadily climbed from 2006 through 2014, the OCC said, with nearly half of all cases investigated related to sales misconduct. ,In bringing its charges, the OCC said the eight individuals failed to adequately perform their responsibilities, which contributed to the bank's systemic sales practices problems. ,""The misconduct of these individuals allowed the practices to continue for years, affecting millions of bank customers and thousands of lower-level bank employees,"" it said.

" (This January 21 story corrects reference to Copa being the only Latin American airline with a 737 MAX simulator, clarifies 245 refers to 737 MAX pilots not total pilots in paragraph 20) ,By Allison Lampert, Jamie Freed and David Shepardson ,MONTREAL/SYDNEY/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Airlines are scrambling to book time in 737 MAX training facilities as far afield as Fiji, Iceland and Panama, operators said, after Boeing Co recommended pilots be trained in one of the few simulators replicating the latest model. ,That means thousands of pilots from more than 54 airlines need to squeeze into about three dozen 737 MAX simulators around the world before they can fly the plane.  ,""Boeing is recommending that all 737 MAX pilots undergo training in a 737 MAX simulator prior to flying the aircraft in commercial service,"" the company told Reuters on Tuesday evening, the first confirmation of its new policy.  ,On Jan. 7, the company had recommended using a simulator but did not specify what type. ,The 737 MAX has been grounded since March 2019 after two fatal crashes and cannot return to service until regulators approve software changes and training plans. ,The estimated 34 737 MAX simulators in service, produced separately by CAE Inc and Textron Inc's simulator and training division TRU, are less than a quarter of the number of older 737 NG simulators certified by U.S. and European regulators. ,""I think that what a shortage of simulators will mean is the fleet of MAXes will start flying more slowly than what the airlines would like,"" said Gudmundur Orn Gunnarsson, managing director of TRU Flight Training Iceland, a joint venture between Icelandair and Textron's simulator and training division. ,""In the beginning it was said that simulator training would not be needed,"" he said. ""This changes it totally."" ,Gunnarsson said TRU Flight Training Iceland had more inquiries than usual from potential airline customers about the use of its 737 MAX simulator since Boeing's Jan. 7 announcement.  ,Boeing said on Tuesday it did not expect to win approval for returning the 737 MAX to service until mid-year, longer than previous estimates, in part because regulators are working on new pilot training requirements. ,Many airlines did not order 737 MAX simulators, assuming they could rely on the older 737 NG simulators because the types were so similar. ,Simulators can cost C$10 million ($7.64 million) to C$20 million each, with the 737 MAX at the upper end, CAE said. Hourly rates for simulator training can cost $500 to $1,000, it said.  ,High demand for 737 MAX simulators has led the Montreal-company and its rival TRU to produce simulators for customers they have yet to line up. ,""Customers are making increasing inquiries from all over the globe,"" a TRU spokeswoman said. ,South Korean low-cost carrier Eastar Jet, which does not have a 737 MAX simulator, said it had already contacted Boeing, other airlines and training centers. ,""With limited MAX simulators available, we expect carriers will likely face challenges to book slots for MAX simulators,"" said an Eastar official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter and spoke on condition of anonymity. ,Fiji Airways spent more than $10 million to buy a 737 MAX simulator to help save on the costs and lost productivity of sending pilots to Singapore, Australia and the United States for training, said its chief operating officer, Paul Doherty. ,The carrier uses its simulator 35% to 42% of the available hours to train its 70 737 pilots and had plans to sell the additional time. Now it is getting calls from airlines thousands of miles away.  ,""We have got interest ... particularly from Asia,"" Doherty said. ""We are expecting some from the U.S. Our focus is to really develop our own pilots and to provide the best for Fiji Airways, but we are also very happy to help other airlines that need some time. That could be a real choke point, I think, for a lot of airlines."" ,Panamanian carrier Copa Holdings SA, one of the few Latin American airlines with a 737 MAX simulator, said it was seeing a lot of demand, although it was not authorized to disclose the interested carriers.

"PARIS (Reuters) - U.S. television streaming company Netflix has opened a new Paris office and plans to develop more than 20 original French-language productions in 2020, it said on Friday.  ,Launched in 2014 in France - where it employs 40 people, and has existing operations in Paris - Netflix has developed 24 French titles, including six films, nine series and three documentaries.  ,It plans to produce several new shows over the coming years as well as a range of series and films made by production partners.  ,Netflix has seen its customer base grow quickly in recent years thanks to a rich catalog of movies and series, allowing it to grab market share from long-established local pay TV operator Canal+ - a unit of media conglomerate Vivendi - which had 16.2 million subscribers at the end of 2018, including 8.3 million in mainland France. ,In an interview with French weekly L'Express, Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings said his company now has 6.7 million subscribers in France and that the firm will invest more than 100 million euros to create new French-language content in 2020.  ,""We are becoming a major French producer, we are no longer just a machine to export Hollywood content,"" he said, adding that he was set to meet with French president Emmanuel Macron. ,Among the new productions are the new film BigBug, a comedy set in the future co-written by ""Amelie"" director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, and a series about gentleman-burglar Arsene Lupin, starring French actor Omar Sy. ,Netflix's offensive follows the French government saying it would force platforms such as Netflix to dedicate up to 25% of their French revenue to fund domestic French content production. ,Netflix has come under fire in France for disrupting a finely regulated system of subsidies meant to encourage production of French-language films and series. ,""Like Canal+, we recognize that we have obligations.

"ST. LOUIS (Reuters) - It was more than a year ago when St. Louis Federal Reserve bank President James Bullard started raising the alarm about a U.S. bond market where interest rates seemed to show investors losing faith in the economy, a risky environment for the Fed to carry out planned rate increases. ,As 2020 gets under way, the closely watched spreads between long- and short-term Treasury securities still don't look completely healthy. ,But with months of market turbulence and three rate cuts now in the rear view mirror, Bullard says he is ready to stand down, leave policy on hold for up to a year, and see what transpires. ,""We eased substantially in 2019. That will come on board in 2020,"" just as the United States and China also signal an easing of trade tensions with the Wednesday signing of a preliminary agreement, Bullard said in a Reuters interview. ""We will see how much impact we have in the first half of 2020 and probably all the way through 2020, and then we will see where we are."" ,That's a shift for Bullard from what had been aggressive stumping, beginning as far back as late 2017, for the Fed to beware of raising interest rates too much, in part because of the behavior of the bond market. ,But it is also further indication of a broader consensus that may well keep the Fed on the sidelines, with interest rates unchanged, throughout a potentially turbulent U.S. presidential election season. ,The last year was a rocky one for the Fed, with markets upended by a global trade war, the central bank the target of verbal attacks by President Donald Trump, and policymakers divided on what the economy needed. Over the year there were dissents against the Fed's quarter-point rate cuts coming from those who believed policy should be even easier and those who thought the opposite. ,Bullard dissented twice in favor of deeper and faster cuts.    ,As the year ended, Fed officials across the spectrum agreed they could pause any further rate moves until something in the economy changes. ,For those like Bullard who might have wanted even lower rates, it's an acknowledgement the economy is still absorbing the massive shift toward looser monetary policy that the Fed engineered last year when it lowered the overnight policy rate to its current range of between 1.5% and 1.75%. For those who might have once been concerned about inflation or financial risks it's an acknowledgement that as of now there's little evidence of either. ,If 2019 had a theme, Bullard said, it was of the Fed fully coming to terms with the fact that low unemployment, low inflation, low interest rates, and a seemingly stable financial system can coexist. In standard theory they often conflict, with low unemployment sparking higher inflation. At this point, even the committee's most ardent inflation ""hawks"" see last year's rate cuts as a potential adjustment to that new world - a ""reset,"" as Kansas City Fed President Esther George called it Tuesday. She dissented against all three rate cuts last year on the view rates were low enough. ,Neither Bullard nor George vote on policy this year. ,""It was a year where we really came to grips with the idea that we were not going to go to 1990s or 2000 level interest rates in the United States,"" Bullard said. ""Not only did we quit trying...but we turned around and went the other way."" ,It has been a longstanding debate, but since last fall policymakers have marked down their estimates of the underlying long-run ""neutral"" rate of interest to around half a percentage point, once accounting for inflation. Bullard thinks it is more like zero, but the point is made: the world's different than when inflation-adjusted rates of 2% to 3% were the norm. ,So is the United States in the clear? ,Bullard says he now thinks 2020 could hold positive surprises as businesses finish readjusting to a less predictable trade environment, and start rolling out new strategies, methods and supply chains to cope. A tight labor market, he feels, could prompt capital investment that improves productivity.  ,And if trade uncertainty lifts, the United States ""might grow faster than 2019, and it is that kind of dynamic that would lead us back to a better expected inflation environment,"" that meets or exceeds the Fed's 2% inflation target.  ,He hasn't turned his back on the yield curve. The roughly quarter percentage point spread between 10- and 2-year Treasuries is well below what it was in the 1990s, say, during another extended era of growth. Bullard said he'd rest easier if it climbed to at least half a percent, signaling stronger market faith in growth and inflation. ,But that's no reason to argue for more rate cuts now, he said. ,""We are going in the right direction."" ",Business News,1/17/2020 12:14,The yield curve's still weird. Fed's Bullard is okay with that
"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's economic growth cooled to its weakest in nearly 30 years in 2019 amid a bruising trade war with the United States, and more stimulus is expected this year as Beijing tries to boost sluggish investment and demand. ,But data on Friday also showed the world's second-largest economy ended the rough year on a somewhat firmer note as a trade truce revived business confidence and earlier growth boosting measures finally appeared to be taking hold. ,As expected, China's growth slowed to 6.1% last year, from 6.6% in 2018, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed. Though still strong by global standards, and within the government's target range, it was the weakest expansion since 1990. ,This year is crucial for the ruling Communist Party to fulfill its goal of doubling gross domestic product (GDP) and incomes in the decade to 2020, and turning China into a ""moderately prosperous"" nation. ,Analysts reckon that long-term target would need growth this year to remain around 6%, though top officials have warned the economy may face even greater pressure than in 2019. ,More recent data, along with optimism over a Phase 1 U.S.-China trade deal signed on Wednesday, have raised hopes that the  economy may be bottoming out.         ,Fourth-quarter GDP rose 6.0% from a year earlier, steadying from the third quarter, though still the weakest in nearly three decades. And December industrial output, investment and retail sales all rose more than expected after an improved showing in November. ,Policy sources have told Reuters that Beijing plans to set a lower growth target of around 6% this year from last year's 6-6.5%, relying on increased infrastructure spending to ward off a sharper slowdown. Key targets are due to be announced in March. ,On a quarterly basis, the economy grew 1.5% in October-December, also the same pace as the previous three months. ,""We expect China's growth rate will come further down to below 6%"" in the coming year, said Masaaki Kanno, chief economist at Sony Financial Holdings in Tokyo.  ,""The Chinese economy is unlikely to fall abruptly because of ... government policies, but at the same time the trend of a further slowdown of the economy will remain unchanged.""     ,December data released along with GDP showed a surprising acceleration in industrial output and a more modest pick-up in    investment growth, while retail sales were solid. ,Industrial output grew 6.9% from a year earlier, the strongest pace in nine months, while retail sales rose 8.0%. Fixed-asset investment rose 5.4% for the full year, but growth had plumbed record lows in autumn. ,Easing trade tensions have made manufacturers more optimistic about the business outlook, analysts said, though many of the tit-for-tat tariffs both sides imposed during the trade war remain in place. ,""Despite the recent uptick in activity, we think it is premature to call the bottom of the current economic cycle,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard and Martin Rasmussen at Capital Economics said in a note.  ,""External headwinds should ease further in the coming quarters thanks to the 'Phase One' trade deal and a recovery in global growth. But we think this will be offset by a renewed slowdown in domestic demand, triggering further monetary easing by the People's Bank."" ,Among other key risks this year, infrastructure — a key part of Beijing's stabilization strategy — has remained stubbornly weak. ,Infrastructure investment grew just 3.8% in 2019, decelerating from 4% in January-November, despite sharply higher local government bond issuance and other policy measures. ,""This shows that local governments continued to face funding constraints...,"" said Tommy Xie, China economist at OCBC Bank in Singapore. ,Some analysts are also worried about signs of cooling in the housing market, a key economic driver.  ,Property investment growth hit a two-year low in December even as it grew at a solid 9.9% pace in 2019. Property sales fell 0.1%, the first annual decline in five years.  ,Beijing has worked for years to keep speculation and home price rises in check, and officials vowed last year they would not use the property market as a form of short-term stimulus. ,China will roll out more support measures this year as the economy faces further pressure, Ning Jizhe, head of the Statistical bureau told a news conference. ,Ning noted that per capital GDP in China had surpassed $10,000 for the first time last year. But analysts believe more painful reforms are needed to generate additional growth. ,Beijing has been relying on a mix of fiscal and monetary steps to weather the current downturn, cutting taxes and allowing local governments to sell huge amounts of bonds to fund infrastructure projects. ,Banks also have been encouraged to lend more, especially to small firms, with new yuan loans hitting a record 16.81 trillion yuan ($2.44 trillion) in 2019. ,The central bank has cut banks' reserve requirement ratios (RRR) - the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves - eight times since early 2018, most recently this month. China has also seen modest cuts in some lending rates. ,Analysts polled by Reuters expect further cuts in both RRR and key interest rates this year. ,But Chinese leaders have repeatedly pledged they will not embark on massive stimulus like that during the 2008-09 global crisis, which quickly juiced growth rates but left a mountain of debt. ,Containing financial system risks will remain a high priority for policymakers this year. Corporate bond defaults hit a new record last year, while state-linked firms had to step in to rescue several troubled smaller banks. ,Even with additional stimulus and assuming the trade truce holds, economists polled by Reuters expect China's growth will cool this year to 5.9%.

Trump told Warsh in front of the crowd gathered in the White House East Room for the U.S.-China Phase 1 deal-signing ceremony.  ,""You're a forceful person,"" Trump continued. ""In fact, I thought you were too forceful, maybe, for the job, and I would have been very happy with you. But Kevin, thank you for being here. You understand that very well, right?"" ,Trump would have to win re-election in November in order to have another chance to name a Fed chair. Powell's four-year term as Fed chair expires in 2022. Few expect that Trump would reappoint Powell given his repeated attacks. ,Trump followed his comments on Warsh by veering into other familiar Fed complaints - that the dollar is stronger than he would like and that countries like Germany have negative interest rates when U.S. rates are substantially higher. He blames Fed policy under Powell for both. ,""Bothers me when Germany and other countries are getting paid to borrow money,"" Trump said. ,Trump's remarks quickly caught the attention of economists on social media, several of whom wondered why Trump believes Warsh would be the ""low rates guy"" he pines after for the Fed chair job. Warsh resigned from the Fed in 2011 after voicing criticism of the central bank's bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing, which the U.S. central bank undertook in response to the financial crisis in a move to lower long-term interest rates and stimulate the economy. ,""That would be interesting since Warsh's first & last instinct is to hike rates,"" Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at international tax firm RSM, said on Twitter.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retail sales increased for a third straight month in December, with households buying a range of goods even as they cut back on purchases of motor vehicles, suggesting the economy maintained a moderate growth pace at the end of 2019. ,Other data on Thursday showed the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits dropped for a fifth straight week last week, indicating the labor market remained strong despite a recent slowdown in job growth. That should help sustain consumer spending and probably keep the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year, on track.  ,The Federal Reserve on Wednesday described the economy as having continued to expand modestly in the final six weeks of 2019. The U.S. central bank has signaled that it could keep interest rates unchanged at least through this year after reducing borrowing costs three times in 2019. ,""There's more fuel in the tank of this economic expansion,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York.  ,The Commerce Department said retail sales increased 0.3% last month. Data for November was revised up to show retail sales gaining 0.3% instead of rising 0.2% as previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast retail sales would gain 0.3% in December. Compared to December of last year, retail sales accelerated 5.8%. Sales increased 3.6% in 2019.  ,Excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rebounded 0.5% last month after falling by a downwardly revised 0.1% in November. ,The so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product. They were previously reported to have edged up 0.1% in November. Core retail sales for October were also revised lower. ,Overall sales rose in December despite retailers such as Target Corp (,), Kohl's (,), J.C. Penney (,) and Macy's (,) reporting a decline in sales for the holiday period as foot traffic in malls dropped. ,Though a report last week showed a slowdown in job growth in December and the increase in the annual wage gain retreating to below 3.0%, the labor market remains on solid footing. In a separate report on Thursday, the Labor Department said initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 10,000 to a seasonally adjusted 204,000 for the week ended Jan. 11. ,Economists had forecast claims would rise to 216,000 in the latest week. ,The dollar .DXY was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the S&P 500 , index crossing the 3,300 threshold for the first time, as upbeat earnings from Morgan Stanley (,) and a tech rally added to optimism from an initial U.S.-China trade deal. ,While claims are trending lower, there are some worrying signs emerging. The claims data showed layoffs in manufacturing, transportation and warehousing, construction, educational services and accommodation and food services industries in late 2019 and early 2020. ,Some of the job losses in manufacturing, which were spread across at least eight states, could be related to the 18-month trade war between the United States and China, which has hurt business confidence and undercut capital expenditure. U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He signed a ""Phase 1"" trade deal on Wednesday, a first step toward defusing the trade war. ,But with U.S. duties remaining in effect on $360 billion of Chinese imports, about two thirds of the total, economists do not expect the initial deal to provide a boost to manufacturing, which is in recession. ,A third report on Thursday from the Philadelphia Fed showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region accelerated in January, with manufacturers reporting receiving more orders. But a measure of unfilled orders at factories in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware contracted and manufacturers cut hours for employees.  ,Even as trade tensions have eased, a pall remains over manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the economy. Boeing (,) has suspended production of its fast-selling 737 MAX jetliner starting this month and ripple effects are already being felt, with a major supplier announcing layoffs last week. ,""Manufacturing will grow at a subdued pace in 2020, constrained by slower external and domestic growth as well as ongoing uncertainty on the trade policy front despite the Phase-one trade deal,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ,For now, consumers appear set to continue driving the economy, also thanks to house prices and a bullish stock market. ,Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, grew at a 3.2% annualized rate in the third quarter. Given the downward revisions to October and November core retail sales, growth in consumer spending is expected to have slowed to around or below a 2.5% rate in the fourth quarter.  ,Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are as high as a 2.5% rate, in part because of a drop in imports, which compressed the trade deficit. The economy expanded at a 2.1% pace in the July-September period.  ,In December, auto sales fell 1.3%, the biggest drop since last January, after increasing 1.5% in November. Higher gasoline prices lifted receipts at service stations, which jumped 2.8%. Online and mail-order retail sales rose 0.2% after being unchanged in November. ,Sales at electronics and appliance stores rebounded 0.6% in December. Receipts at building material stores surged 1.4% and sales at clothing stores accelerated 1.6%. Spending at furniture stores edged up 0.1%. Americans also spent more at restaurants and bars, with sales rising 0.2% last month. Spending at hobby, musical instrument and book stores rebounded 0.9%.

"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's Belt and Road investment scheme, which aims to connect Europe with Asia, is sidelining European companies and Brussels should review its competition law to level the playing field, a business lobby group said on Thursday. ,Opaque procurement processes and the dominance of giant state-owned Chinese companies mean European companies get only ""crumbs from the table,"" the European Chamber of Commerce in China said in a report. ,It said the European Union should move to force Chinese companies that access the EU procurement market to operate under the same restrictions that EU companies do in China.  ,""If the EU fails to play an active and competitive role, there is a real danger that it could eventually become little more than a peripheral market tacked on to the end of Eurasia,"" the Chamber of Commerce said. ,The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) seeks to build a modern version of the Silk Road to link China with Asia, Europe and beyond through large-scale infrastructure projects that it has launched in more than 60 countries since 2013.   ,European companies are merely ""niche players"" in the BRI, with just 20 chamber members of 132 survey respondents reporting that they had bid on BRI projects, chamber President Joerg Wuttke told reporters on Monday ahead of the report's release. ,Those European companies that did get involved did so mainly through Chinese business partners or the government, and usually their role was to provide specific technologies or expertise that the Chinese side lacked, the report said.  ,Both Chinese and foreign companies can participate in BRI projects through open, transparent means, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily briefing in Beijing on Thursday. Many European firms have participated in the BRI, he said.  ,Chinese national champions were also gaining ""monopolistic power"" in some BRI countries by building digital infrastructure that involved complete packages of software and hardware based on Chinese standards, according to the Chamber's report. ,Such companies benefited from heavy state support at home, which helped them beat international competitors.  ,""Smaller, less developed countries that do not have the capacity for setting their own standards will certainly be put under considerable pressure to simply adopt Chinese standards,"" the report said.  ,The EU needed to allow its own companies to scale up by reviewing its competition law, it said.

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - China's pledge to buy U.S. farm goods based on ""market conditions"" during the Phase 1 trade deal signing ceremony on Wednesday added to doubts among farmers and commodity traders over Beijing's lingering tariffs on U.S. exports.  ,The agreement, meant to reduce tensions after nearly two years of a tit-for-tat tariff war, included a pledge by China to purchase at least an additional $12.5 billion worth of agricultural goods in 2020 and at least $19.5 billion over the 2017 level of $24 billion in 2021. ,President Donald Trump's insistence on a big commitment to buy farm products was a major sticking point in talks leading up to the signing, people briefed on the negotiations said, as China wanted the freedom to buy based on demand. ,Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, standing beside Trump, said on Wednesday that Chinese firms will buy American products ""based on market conditions.""  ,Following the comment, the price of soybeans, the top U.S. farm product shipped to China by value before the trade war, fell to a one-month low on the Chicago Board of Trade futures market SH0. ,""Soybeans broke after that,"" said Terry Reilly, senior commodities analyst with Futures International. ""'When the market dictates' means they may not come back for 36 months. Who knows?

""It's a world market now."" ,The agreement did not reduce tariffs on major U.S. agricultural exports to China, though Trump said tariffs would come off in a Phase 2 agreement.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investor Jeffrey Ubben, already betting there is money to be made from coaxing corporations into being better citizens, gained an ally on Tuesday when BlackRock Inc chief Laurence Fink told companies to tackle climate change or face his wrath. ,Ubben, who founded $17 billion ValueAct Capital in 2000, spent a year building an ESG portfolio and is fast becoming one of Wall Street's biggest evangelists for investments with strong environmental, social and governance components. ,Now a like-minded and powerful investor has joined the crusade as Fink sent his annual letter to corporate chiefs warning them to act or face anger from investors like BlackRock over how unsustainable business practices might curb their future wealth. ,""It is pretty exciting,"" Ubben said at a Reuters BreakingViews event on Tuesday when asked about Fink sounding the alarm on a crisis that Fink called the most long-term and structural in his more than 40 years in finance. ,For Ubben and other investors pushing for changes on things ranging from carbon emissions to safer workplaces for employees, BlackRock's new stance may aid their work. Fink said BlackRock, which invests $7 trillion and is the world's biggest asset manager, would be ""increasingly disposed"" to cast critical proxy votes tied to sustainability. ,""Now I can call three shareholders,"" Ubben said, referring to index funds BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street. ,""If I can turn that vote on, (these changes) can happen fast. It is pretty cool.""  ,Three years ago Ubben elevated a long-term partner, Mason Morfit, to chief investment officer at ValueAct and took time to step back and lay the ground work for the ValueAct Spring fund. The fund quickly attracted over $1 billion but Ubben then hit the pause button and began turning potential investors away. ,""I want to go slowly,"" Ubben said, noting that he needs to take time to construct the fund carefully and spend time identifying the portfolio companies. And he still has to find ways to catalyze real change with these types of investments. ,One of the Spring fund's investments is Hawaiian Electric Industries  where Ubben has been pushing for changes and said several times that he would like the company to consider outsiders in its succession planning for CEO Constance Lau. Lau has been CEO since 2006 and board chair Jeffrey Watanabe said in a regulatory filing last year that the company has ""robust, timely and appropriate succession planning processes in place."" , Ubben said ValueAct is working with the company and declined to say whether he wants a board seat to help hasten change. ,Ubben said most companies were guilty of short-term thinking, and only about a third of corporate chiefs want to do good by, for example, investing in clean energy or boosting employee wages. ,The remainder were simply trying to shield themselves from activist investors like himself, he added. ,But as ESG investing captures investors' imagination - investors funneled $20.6 billion in net new money into these types of funds last year, according to Morningstar data - Ubben said it can become the path to breaking the short-term investing mold.    ,""ESG, that's the ticket that's how we get the long-term back,"" he said. ,Paving the road to real change requires ""courage and getting off the 90 day clock,"" Ubben said, referring to the typical company reporting cycle. ,Ubben said that in recent years he has stopped growing his own net worth and gives away his income. But not everyone in the hedge fund industry is as generous, he acknowledged.  ,""This is an industry populated by people who have a (money) hoarding problem,"" he said.

" (This Jan. 14 story corrects reference in paragraph 12 to '$4.2 billion' from '$4.2 million.') ,By Tracy Rucinski ,CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines Inc on Tuesday reported a fourth-quarter profit that beat estimates, boosted in part by customers it gained from rival airlines' 737 MAX cancellations and growing air travel demand.  ,Airlines that own Boeing Co's 737 MAX are cancelling more than 10,000 monthly flights in total as the aircraft remains grounded following two deadly crashes. ,Delta does not operate the MAX, enabling it to expand its flight capacity and capture new customers as peers like Southwest Airlines Co have had to scale back. ,""There's no question that we're picking up new customers, but that's not the main driver of our performance,"" Chief Executive Ed Bastian told Reuters, citing strong customer loyalty at a time when air travel demand continues to rise. ,American Airlines Group Inc and United Airlines Holdings Inc are scheduling flights without the MAX into early June, in anticipation of extra simulator training requirements for pilots once regulators finally approve the jet to fly again. ,Southwest, the other U.S. MAX carrier, so far is cancelling flights into April. ,Delta has not picked up premium revenues from rivals over the MAX but Bastian said the carrier would continue to see a marginal benefit while the jet remains grounded. ,Net income climbed 8% to $1.1 billion in the quarter through Dec. 31 from a year earlier. Adjusted earnings per share hit $1.70, beating analysts' expectations for $1.40, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. ,Lower fuel costs and a 9-cent-per-share gain from the sale of its stake in Brazil's Gol also propped up profit. ,Quarterly operating revenue rose 7% to $11.4 billion, and Delta expects growth of 5% to 7% in the first quarter as U.S. demand rises in spite of heightened geopolitical tensions.  ,Shares were up 4.2% at $61.94, with Delta's positive comments on travel demand lifting shares of other U.S. airlines as well.. ,Delta, the first of its peers to report quarterly results, generated $4.2 billion of free cash flow for the year, and expects to repeat that this year, enabling new investments in technology to improve passenger experience. ,J.P.Morgan analyst Jamie Baker called the cash flow ""unchartered territory for any airline."" ,One issue for 2020 will be ongoing contract negotiations with pilots. ,As for new aircraft, Delta is still interested in Boeing's proposed new midsized airplane, known as the NMA, despite the planemaker's delayed decision on whether to launch the new aircraft as it continues to deal with the 737 MAX fallout. ,Delta wants to remain a customer of both Boeing and Airbus SE but the longer Boeing takes to decide on the NMA's launch, the fewer options the carrier has, Bastian said, noting Airbus' A321XLR and A330 could be alternatives.  ,The airline is also still interested in investing around 100 million euros ($111.34 million) in the rescue of Italian flagship carrier Alitalia, Bastian said, and is working on anti-trust immunity in South America after closing this month the acquisition of a 20% stake in LATAM Airlines Group. , (This story published on Jan. 14, corrects reference in paragraph 12 to '$4.2 billion' from '$4.2 million.')

"(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (,) will set an expense target at its investor day later this month, management said on Wednesday, after the bank missed Wall Street profit expectations due to inflated costs. ,A big portion of Goldman's bloated expense line came from setting aside another $1.1 billion to cover legal and regulatory costs related to the 1MDB Malaysian corruption scandal. ,However, Goldman also spent more on compensation, technology, occupancy costs and professional fees, some of which pertained to new businesses, like the credit card it launched with Apple Inc APPL.O and its transaction banking business. ,The bank's operating expenses rose 42% in the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year. ,Overall, the bank spent 68 cents for every dollar of revenue it produced in 2019, up from 64 cents per dollar the prior year. Investors watch that efficiency metric closely, to gauge how well a company manages costs. ,Several analysts quizzed Chief Executive Officer David Solomon and Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr about costs on an earnings call, asking when the bank's investments in various businesses will start paying off. Goldman spent roughly $700 million on growth initiatives in 2019, before taxes. ,Management plans to offer an expense target ""in very concrete terms"" at its investor day on Jan. 29, Scherr said. ,He also said Goldman will move away from a $5-billion fresh annual revenue target it outlined in 2017, confirming a Reuters report from November. The bank will instead set measures for returns and efficiency, which better represent its goals, Scherr said. ,Scherr also mentioned that of its equity investments, which are investments the bank makes with its own money, it dumped its shares of Uber Technologies Inc (,) and reduced the amount of shares it owned in Tradeweb Markets Inc. (,). ,Goldman shares rose 0.3% to $246.34 in afternoon trading. ,During the fourth-quarter, Goldman's profit fell 26%, to $1.7 billion, or $4.69 per share, from $2.3 billion, or $6.04 per share in the same period of 2018. ,Analysts had expected a profit of $5.47 per share, on average, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv. Some said the bank beat estimates by a stretch when excluding legal and regulatory provisions. ,All but one of Goldman's four new business units reported better quarterly results. ,Global markets, which houses the trading business, reported $3.5 billion in revenue, up 33%, thanks to easy comparisons with the year-ago period. The strong trading performance mirrored trends at major rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co (,), Citigroup Inc (,) and Bank of America Corp (,). ,The only sore spot for Goldman during the quarter was investment banking, where revenue fell 6% to $2.1 billion, hurt by lower M&A advisory fees, as well as a slowdown in corporate lending. ,Goldman changed its reporting lines this month in response to long-standing requests for more transparency from analysts and investors.  ,The new structure offers more insight into consumer banking, a pillar of Solomon's strategy to offset sharp declines in trading revenue over the past decade or so. ,That business is a tiny but fast-growing part of Goldman Sachs. It represented just 2.4% of the bank's revenue in 2019, at $864 million, which was up 41% from the prior year. ,Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr characterized the results as encouraging, because of Goldman's revenue growth, its progress in building out new businesses and signs that it is getting closer to resolving 1MDB matters. ,The government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak set up the 1MDB fund in 2009, and the U.S. Justice Department estimated $4.5 billion was misappropriated by high-level fund officials and their associates between 2009 and 2014. Goldman has been investigated by regulators in at least 14 countries for its underwriting role. ,Solomon said the bank is actively engaged with authorities to settle as quickly as possible, though he cautioned that there is no guarantee of a settlement or when one might occur. ,Schorr said it could take time before the bank is generating significantly better returns for investors. ,""Markets won't always be this strong and the new builds will take years to achieve scale and materially contribute,"" he wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.

"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He signed a deal on Wednesday in the White House that cut some U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods in exchange for Chinese pledges to purchase more of American farm, energy and  manufactured goods and address some U.S. complaints about intellectual property practices.  ,Following are details of the deal released by the United States Trade Representative. Beijing has not yet released a version of the deal in Chinese, after an extended translation process that continued until Tuesday night.  ,China agreed to increase purchases of American products and services by at least $200 billion over the next two years. ,China bought $130 billion in U.S. goods in 2017, before the trade war began, and $56 billion in services, U.S. data show. ,China has committed to $77.7 billion in additional manufacturing purchases over two years, from the 2017 level, the text says, which will be $32.9 billion increase in 2020 and a $44.8 billion increase in 2021.   ,China has committed to buying at least $52.4 billion in additional energy purchases over the two years, from a baseline of $9.1 billion in 2017. That will be broken into $18.5 billion additional in 2020 and $33.9 billion in 2020. ,China will also purchase $37.6 billion in services from U.S. companies over the two years, $12.8 billion above the 2017 level in 2020 and $25.1 billion above the level in 2021.  ,China ""shall ensure"" additional purchases of U.S. agriculture products by $32 billion over two years, the deal says, including $12.5 billion above the corresponding 2017 baseline of $24 billion in 2020 and $19.5 billion above the baseline in 2021.   ,That would give an average annual total of about $40 billion, a number Trump has touted before. ,The United States will cut by half the tariff rate it imposed on Sept 1. on a $120 billion list of Chinese goods, to 7.5%.  ,U.S. tariffs of 25% on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods put in place earlier will remain immediately unchanged. These could be rolled back as part of a Phase 2 trade negotiation, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Wednesday.   ,Tariffs that were scheduled to go into effect on Dec. 15 on nearly $160 billion worth of Chinese goods, including cellphones, laptop computers, toys and clothing, are suspended indefinitely. China's retaliatory Dec. 15 tariffs, including a 25% tariff on U.S.-made autos, have also be suspended.  ,The deal includes stronger Chinese legal protections for patents, trademarks, copyrights, including improved criminal and civil procedures to combat online infringement, pirated and counterfeit goods. ,The deal contains commitments by China to follow through on previous pledges to eliminate any pressure for foreign companies to transfer technology to Chinese firms as a condition of market access, licensing or administrative approvals and to eliminate any government advantages for such transfers. ,China also agreed to refrain from directly supporting outbound investment aimed at acquiring foreign technology to meet its industrial plans — transactions already restricted by stronger U.S. security reviews.   ,The currency agreement contains pledges by China to refrain from competitive currency devaluations and to not target its exchange rate for a trade advantage — language that China has accepted for years as part of its commitments to the Group of 20 major economies. ,As part of the deal China has made ""enforceable commitments to refrain from competitive devaluation"" and agreed to publish relevant data on exchange rates and external balances, the U.S. Treasury said Monday.  ,The deal subjects any violations of currency commitments to the agreement's enforcement mechanism, under which they could incur U.S. tariffs.  ,A senior Trump administration official said the currency agreement is based on provisions in the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement trade deal, which require the three countries to disclose monthly data on international reserve balances and intervention in foreign exchange markets, along with quarterly balance-of-payments data and other public reporting to the International Monetary Fund. ,The United States and China will resolve differences over how the deal is implemented through bilateral consultations, starting at the working level and escalating to top-level officials.  ,If these consultations do not resolve disputes, there is a process for imposing tariffs or other penalties. ,Lighthizer told reporters the United States expected neither side would retaliate if appropriate action was taken as part of the process and following ""consultation in good faith."" ,U.S. officials said the deal includes improved access to China's financial services market for U.S. companies, including in banking, insurance, securities and credit rating services. It aims to address a number of longstanding U.S. complaints about investment barriers in the sector, including foreign equity limitations and discriminatory regulatory requirements. ,China, which has pledged for years to open up its financial services sector to more foreign competition, said the deal would boost imports of financial services from the United States.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. producer prices edged up in December as a rise in the cost of goods was offset by weakness in services, the latest indication of tame inflation pressures that could allow the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates unchanged this year. ,The report from the Labor Department on Wednesday came in the wake of data on Tuesday showing a small rise in consumer prices in December. Inflation has remained tame even as the unemployment rate has dropped to near a 50-year low and the longest economic expansion on record entered its 11th year. ,""There is still little sign of any significant rise in price pressures at the start of the inflation pipeline, underlining our view that the Fed will keep interest rates on hold for the foreseeable future,"" said Andrew Hunter, a senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics in London. ,The producer price index for final demand ticked up 0.1% last month after being unchanged in November, the government said. In the 12 months through December, the PPI increased 1.3% after gaining 1.1% in November.  ,For all of 2019, the PPI rose 1.3%. That was the smallest gain since 2015 and followed a 2.6% increase in 2018. ,Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the PPI climbing 0.2% in December and advancing 1.3% on a year-on-year basis. ,Excluding the volatile food, energy and trade services components, producer prices also nudged up 0.1% in December after being unchanged in November. The so-called core PPI rose 1.5% in the 12 months through December after gaining 1.3% in November. Core PPI increased 1.5% in 2019, also the smallest advance since 2015, after rising 2.8% in 2018. ,The Fed, which has a 2% annual inflation target, tracks the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index for monetary policy. The core PCE price index rose 1.6% on a year-on-year basis in November, and undershot the Fed's target in the first 11 months of 2019. December PCE price data will be published later this month.  ,The U.S. central bank last month left interest rates steady and signaled monetary policy could remain on hold at least through this year after it reduced borrowing costs three times in 2019. Inflation could remain tame, with the government reporting last Friday that the annual increase in wage growth retreated to below 3.0% in December even as the unemployment rate held at 3.5% and a broader measure of labor market slack dropped to a record 6.7%. ,Inflation has been muted despite the United States imposing tariffs on billions of dollars worth of imported Chinese goods. President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He signed an initial trade deal on Wednesday, a first step toward defusing an 18-month trade war. ,Washington suspended some tariffs that had been due to go into effect and halved others. U.S. duties remain in effect on $360 billion of Chinese imports, about two thirds of the total.  ,The trade war has hurt business confidence, pushing manufacturing into recession. Despite the easing in trade tensions, business sentiment has remained subdued.  ,In a separate report on Wednesday, the New York Fed said its business conditions index rose to a reading of 4.8 in January from 3.3 in December. It said measures assessing the business outlook over the next six months ""suggested that optimism about future conditions remained restrained."" ,While a third report from the Fed showed the economy  ""continued to expand modestly in the final six weeks of 2019,"" the central bank said manufacturing activity was ""essentially flat"" in most of the 12 districts. The Fed also noted that ""tariffs and trade uncertainty continued to weigh on some businesses"" in many districts. ,""We believe manufacturing activity will remain lethargic this year,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""While the U.S. and China signed the 'Phase One' trade deal today, we believe a resolution to key outstanding disagreements will remain unresolved."" ,The dollar slipped against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the S&P 500 , near an all-time high. ,In December, wholesale energy prices jumped 1.5% after increasing 0.6% in November. They were boosted by a 3.7% acceleration in gasoline prices, which followed a 2.3% rise in November. Goods prices rose 0.3% last month, matching November's rise. Gasoline accounted for more than 60% of the increase in goods prices last month. Wholesale food prices fell 0.2% after surging 1.1% in November. Core goods prices ticked up 0.1% last month. They increased 0.2% in November. ,""There is no evidence that tariffs provided manufacturers with the cover to raise prices,"" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic adviser at Brean Capital in New York. ,The cost of services was unchanged in December after dropping 0.3% in November. Prices for healthcare services fell 0.1% in December after slipping 0.2% in the prior month. The weakness in wholesale healthcare costs is in stark contrast with strong readings in December's consumer inflation report.  ,Portfolio management fees jumped 1.9% after rebounding 1.2% in November.

"(Reuters) - China has agreed to buy two types of rare earth metals from the United States as part of an initial trade deal inked on Wednesday, a move likely to boost U.S. production of the strategic minerals. ,The agreement, signed in Washington by Chinese Vice Premier Liu He and U.S. President Donald Trump, gives China two years to ramp up purchases of hundreds of U.S. products, including scandium and yttrium, two of the 17 rare earths commonly used in lighting and computers. ,It was a surprising about-face for China, whose status as the top global producer of the specialized minerals used to make electronics, military weapons and other high-tech equipment was seen as giving it leverage in its trade war with Washington.  ,Chinese President Xi Jinping visited a rare earths facility last May, a step widely interpreted as threatening exports to the United States, which are at their lowest level since 2015. ,The trade agreement does not involve neodymium or praseodymium, the two most commonly used types of rare earths. China dominates their production, as well as the manufacture of rare earths magnets. After rare earths are processed, they must be turned into magnets, otherwise they are of little value to electronics and weapons manufacturers. ,Neither scandium nor yttrium are currently produced in the United States. However, several junior miners are developing U.S. mines to produce them and other rare earths.  ,The initial trade deal effectively gives those junior miners a guaranteed customer, a step that should help in the hunt for project financing. ,""This provides an additional market for U.S. producers,"" said Anthony Marchese, chief executive of Texas Mineral Resources Corp (,), which is developing the Round Top mine in Texas with USA Rare Earth. ,The Round Top project has scandium and yttrium deposits, as do projects under development by UCore Rare Metals Inc (,) and Rare Element Resources Ltd (,).  ,The trade deal comes as the Pentagon has moved in recent months to help fund U.S. rare earth and rare earth magnet projects, part of an attempt to help create a domestic supply chain free from China, according to documents seen by Reuters. ,The rare earths tension between the two countries goes back to at least 2010, when China limited exports to Japan after a diplomatic dispute, sending prices for the niche metals spiking and fueling concerns across the U.S. military that China could do the same to the United States.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of U.S. states suing to block T-Mobile US Inc from merging with Sprint Corp on Wednesday told a federal judge that the deal would raise prices for consumers, while the phone companies pushed back and emphasized they would compete aggressively to push prices down.  ,The states filed a lawsuit in June to block the merger, saying it would harm low-income Americans in particular. ,T-Mobile and Sprint contend that the merger would enable the combined company to compete more effectively with dominant carriers Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc.  ,U.S. District Court Judge Victor Marrero, who will decide the fate of the merger, heard closing arguments in the case on Wednesday. Marrero did not ask any questions of either party and said he would make a decision ""as promptly as possible."" ,Glenn Pomerantz, a lawyer for the states, said that the case would impact at least 130 million customers, since a merger would leave the United States with three major phone carriers instead of four. ,""If this merger goes forward, they're at risk for paying billions of dollars more every single year for those services,"" he said. ,When T-Mobile majority shareholder Deutsche Telekom first contemplated the deal in 2010, it ""expressly and unambiguously admitted that it had potential to reduce price competition,"" Pomerantz said.  ,David Gelfand, an attorney representing T-Mobile, said in his closing statement that the merger would offer cost savings, which would trickle down to lower prices for consumers.  ,The U.S. Justice Department approved the deal in July after the carriers agreed to sell some assets to satellite provider Dish Network Corp, which would create its own cellular network to ensure that there would still be four competitors in the market. The Federal Communications Commission signed off on the deal in October.  ,Executives from the companies, including outspoken T-Mobile Chief Executive John Legere, testified during the trial that Sprint's business was deteriorating and would not survive if it did not merge with T-Mobile. ,The carriers argued that selling Sprint's prepaid business and some wireless spectrum to Dish Network Corp would help the satellite TV provider become a mobile competitor and preserve a fourth wireless company in the industry. ,The states, led by New York and California, maintained that Dish was ill-equipped to become a competitive fourth wireless carrier, and said Wednesday that Dish lacks experience, scale and brand recognition in wireless. ,In rebuttal, Pomerantz emphasized that Sprint could turn itself around the same way T-Mobile had previously when it launched 4G technology. ,""They're not in a dire position; they're in an advantageous situation and they just need to invest in their business and compete,"" he said.

"NEW YORK/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas exports should jump over the next two years if China fulfills its pledges to increase energy purchases under the trade deal between the world's two largest economies signed on Wednesday, executives and traders said.  ,The accord did not specify quantities of the products but it commits China, the world's biggest oil importer and second-largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) importer, to buy $52.4 billion more of U.S. energy supplies over the next two years.  ,U.S. energy executives and analysts welcomed the deal after LNG and crude exports to China largely dried up last year. ,However, many uncertainties about implementing the purchases remain and market reaction was mixed with oil trading lower after the deal signing but rising during the Asian morning. ,China's commitments under the deal amount to an increase of $18.5 billion in 2020 and $33.9 billion in 2021 from a baseline of $9.1 billion in 2017. ,The agreement ""is a step in the right direction that will hopefully restore the burgeoning U.S. LNG trade with China,"" said Jack Fusco, chief executive of Cheniere Energy Inc (,), the largest exporter of U.S. LNG.

"BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China and the United States have agreed to terms of a Phase 1 trade deal on Jan 15 but Beijing has not reduced or waived tariffs on any commodities or energy further. ,A senior Trump administration official confirmed on Wednesday that China will need to issue waivers or adjustments to tariffs to meet its buying commitments.  ,But so far Beijing has not committed to any new waivers or adjustments. ,Late last year, the United States reduced some tariffs and Beijing canceled retaliatory duties that were scheduled to take effect on Dec. 15. ,Before the Dec. 15, 2019, deal, U.S. corn, sorghum, wheat, undenatured ethanol and refined copper cathodes had faced an additional tariff of 10% on shipments to China. Propane, cotton, aluminum scrap, copper scrap and rare earth magnets were all set for an additional 5% duty.  ,Below is a list and timeline showing how China's tariffs on key U.S. commodities and energy items stand after the Phase 1 accord. ,China imposed a 5% tariff on U.S. crude oil shipments from Sept. 1, 2019, the first time U.S. oil had been targeted since the trade war between started more than a year ago. The 5% tariff was not affected by the Phase 1 deal.  ,China, the world's biggest crude importer, has cut U.S. shipments from a record high in 2018. Chinese customs data showed imports in the first 11 months of 2019 fell by nearly half year-on-year to 6.35 million tonnes. Full year imports by origin will be available at the end of January.  ,China already removed an additional 5% tariff on U.S. propane shipments that was set to take effect from Dec. 1, 2019. A 25% duty that China imposed on U.S. propane on Aug. 23, 2018, has remained in place. No new waivers came into effect on Jan 15. ,Chinese firms process U.S. propane into petrochemicals such as propylene. Imports in 2018 were worth an estimated $2 billion. The punitive tariffs nearly killed the business in the first 11 months of 2019, with imports from the U.S.  at 2,443 tonnes. ,China imposed a 10% punitive tariff on U.S. LNG shipments in September 2018, raising it to 25% in June 2019. LNG duties were not affected by the Jan 15 deal. ,Imports of the super-chilled fuel from the U.S. in the first 11 months of 2019 were 258,955 tonnes, much lower than the 2.15 million tonnes imported in the 12 months of 2018, according to Chinese customs. This is a tiny fraction compared to China's total LNG imports in the January-November 2019 period at 53.85 million tonnes.  ,China imposed tariffs of 25% on U.S. methanol and MEG in June 2019. They were not affected by the Jan 15 2020 deal. ,Imports of U.S. methanol from January to November 2019 dropped to 109 tonnes compared with 75,118 tonnes in full-year 2018. China imported only 69,600 tonnes of U.S. MEG in the first 11 months of 2019, compared with 147,890 tonnes bought through the whole year of 2018.  ,These were also a tiny part of China's total January-November 2019 methanol imports at 9.7 million tonnes and MEG imports at 9.03 million tonnes. ,No additional duties have been removed as of Jan 15 but there have been some hefty goodwill waivers on tariffs in recent months. ,A 25% tariff on soybeans in July 2018 had halted all buying by commercial buyers, but Chinese crushers went back to the U.S. market following a trade truce in December 2018. An additional 5% duty came into effect in September. The Chinese government has given tariff exemptions to some U.S. soybean imports. ,China bought 13.85 million tonnes of soybeans from the United States in January-November, down 16.4% from same period in 2018.  ,American pork faces total import duties of 72% after including the 12% ""most-favored nation"" tariff. These duties were not changed in the Jan. 15 deal, but China is expected to boost U.S. meat imports. An outbreak of African swine fever in China has decimated the world's largest pig herd and sent domestic pork prices soaring to record levels.  ,Total import tariffs on U.S. frozen pork went down to 68% from Jan. 1, after a cut in tariff rates on frozen pork shipments from all countries. This did not apply to carcasses, chilled pork and offal.  ,U.S. pork exports to China and Hong Kong were up 49% year-on-year in value at $1.18 billion from January to November 2019. ,No changes to duties on scrap metal on Jan 15. An additional duty of 5% on U.S. aluminum scrap, which would have been effective on Dec. 15, 2019, was canceled last month. The material was already affected by an initial 25% tariff in April 2018, followed by another 25% in August 2018. ,Shipments of aluminum scrap to China were down only 19.7% year-on-year in the first 11 months of 2019, but those of U.S. scrap copper, subject to a 25% tariff since August 2018, crashed by 75.7% over the same period.  ,China in 2019 raised the prospect of restricting rare earth exports to the United States but has not announced any formal curbs or export duties. In the other direction, it has levied 25% tariffs on imports of U.S. rare earth ore and rare earth magnets since June 2019 but canceled an additional 5% tariff on the latter that was due to take effect in December 2019.

"WASHINGTON/HONG KONG (Reuters) - The long-awaited U.S.-China trade deal touted wins for U.S. companies looking to access China's $40 trillion financial sector, but many of the changes were already in the works, with Beijing having stepped up the pace of liberalization last year. ,Under the deal, China has agreed to move forward by nine months a December 2020 deadline for removing foreign ownership caps on securities firms, which includes investment banking, underwriting and brokerage operations. ,The Phase 1 trade deal, signed by U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday, promises improved access to Chinese markets in banking, insurance, asset management, payments and fund management. ,It aims to address a number of longstanding U.S. complaints about barriers to investment in China's financial sector, including foreign equity ownership restrictions, discriminatory regulatory requirements, and opaque licensing processes. ,""China is very eager to get more private funds to invest in the economy"", to help fuel economic growth, said Andrew Collier, managing director of Hong Kong-based Orient Capital Research. But foreign companies will struggle to corner a bigger share of the market from state-owned and private Chinese rivals, he said. ,The deal text said that by no later than April 1, China will remove foreign equity limits and allow U.S. investment banks to participate in local securities businesses.     ,Foreign banks' ownership cap in China securities joint ventures was lifted to 51% in 2018 from 49%.

The companies deny the allegations. ,Bezos said on Wednesday Amazon would invest $1 billion to bring small businesses online in the country, adding to the $5.5 billion the company had committed since 2014. ,""They may have put in a billion dollars but then if they make a loss of a billion dollars every year then they jolly well have to finance that billion dollars,"" Indian trade minister Piyush Goyal told a security conference in New Delhi. ,""So it's not as if they are doing a great favour to India  when they invest a billion dollars.""     ,Amazon did not respond to a request for comment. ,Ahead of Bezos' visit, the Competition Commission of India launched a probe into Amazon and Flipkart to look at allegations of deep discounting and whether the companies discriminate against small sellers. ,The allegations were ""an area of concern for every Indian"", Goyal said.     ,India only allows foreign e-commerce firms to operate marketplace platforms where third-parties sell goods to retail consumers. Small retailers say Amazon and Flipkart circumvent those rules by creating proxy sellers or vendors through which it offers deep discounts, allegations the companies deny. ,Goyal welcomed Amazon's investment over recent years, but questioned whether the funds merely covered losses incurred through discounting. ,Amazon's marketplace unit in India reported a loss of 56.85 billion rupees ($802 million) in the fiscal year ending March 2019, the Economic Times reported in October, citing filings on India's Registrar of Companies. Reuters could not immediately access the filings. ,""How can a marketplace make such a big loss, unless they are indulging in predatory pricing or some unfair trade practices? These are real questions that need answers,"" Goyal said. ,Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was unlikely to meet Bezos during his visit despite repeated requests by the company in light of traders' concerns and the ongoing antitrust investigation, three sources told Reuters on Thursday.  ,Last year, India enforced new stringent rules for foreign investment in e-commerce which forced Amazon to rework its business structures and strained ties between New Delhi and Washington.

"(Reuters) - Korea's Hyundai Group is backing a UK electric vehicle startup that plans to begin selling battery-powered delivery vans in 2021, the companies said on Thursday. ,Hyundai Motor Co (,) and sister firm Kia Motors Corp (,) are making the investment of 100 million euros ($110 million) in Arrival Ltd. ,Founded in 2015 and based in London, Arrival has developed a boxy, futuristic-looking shuttle bus aimed at the commercial delivery market. The company said its van will have a range between charges of 300 miles. ,In a statement, Arrival said it will work with Hyundai and Kia to develop a variety of electric vehicles, initially for the commercial market. Those vehicles will be built on Arrival's modular vehicle platform or ""skateboard"" that bundles motor, batteries and chassis components, similar to the skateboard developed by U.S. startup Rivian. ,Rivian is backed by Ford Motor Co (,) and Amazon (,), and has a contract to build 100,000 electric delivery vans for the e-commerce giant, starting in 2021. ,Hyundai and Kia last year invested $89 million in Rimac Automobili, a nine-year-old Croatian company aspiring to build electric supercars that is also backed by Porsche AG (,). ,Arrival said its vehicles will be equipped with advanced driver assist features and can be upgraded with self-driving systems.  ,The vehicles are designed to sell for the same price as similar models powered by internal combustion engines and to be built in small ""microfactories.""

"(Reuters) - An indigenous group that opposes construction of the Coastal GasLink pipeline in British Columbia will refuse workers access to their land, but in peaceful fashion, according to one of its chiefs. ,The statement comes after Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) established a checkpoint on Monday for access to a remote, forested area along Coastal GasLink's route, aiming to avoid a repeat of protests a year ago that resulted in arrests. ,Police last week launched a criminal investigation after finding trees partly cut and ready to fall, and stacks of tires containing jugs of accelerant along with fuel-soaked rags. ,The C$6.6 billion ($5.1 billion) pipeline, to be operated by TC Energy Corp, would transport gas from near Dawson Creek in northeast B.C. to Kitimat on Canada's Pacific coast and supply the country's largest liquefied natural gas export terminal, called LNG Canada, which is under construction. ,Coastal has the support of all First Nations along the route, but hereditary chiefs of Wet'suwet'en Nation, through which 28% of the 670-kilometre (420-mile) route passes, oppose it. ,The chiefs' opposition highlights the difficulties of advancing resource projects in Canada, where by law governments must meaningfully consult and accommodate indigenous groups.      ,Chief Na'moks of Wet'suwet'en's Beaver Clan said the chiefs will never support Coastal on their land, which was not ceded under treaty. ,""We'll maintain our stance of absolute opposition as well as remaining peaceful,"" Na'moks said in an interview. ""We're not letting them have access."" ,The route runs near rivers that provide salmon for Wet'suwet'en and through pristine forest, Na'moks said.  ,RCMP said it would allow chiefs, government officials, journalists and critical supplies to pass the checkpoint. Wet'suwet'en chiefs have said several of their people were denied passage, which RCMP said was the result of miscommunication. ,Last month, private equity firm KKR & Co Inc and Alberta Investment Management Corp (AIMco) agreed to jointly buy a 65% stake in Coastal GasLink. ,AIMco spokesman Denes Nemeth said the corporation has confidence in TC Energy's ability to deal with opposition, and KKR declined to comment.   ,Construction continues on the pipeline, but not at a site where the chiefs say ancient stone tools were unearthed last year, Coastal said. The company has requested meetings with the chiefs, who have denied them. ,Their opposition caused the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination last month to call for construction to stop on Coastal and two other western Canadian resource projects until they garner greater indigenous support. ,Committee Chairperson Noureddine Amir said he was unaware that Coastal had broad indigenous backing. ,""I did not know that most First Nations agree on that. This is something new that comes to my understanding,"" Amir said in a phone interview from Algiers. Asked why the committee did not gather more information, Amir said its role does not include investigations. ,A court injunction allows police to prevent disruptions to construction, but any arrests could backfire, said Dwight Newman, a law professor at University of Saskatchewan. ,""Arresting some people doesn't necessarily mean that other people go away. It may actually create more resistance,"" he said. ",Business News,1/16/2020 17:54,Indigenous group vows peaceful pipeline opposition as Canadian police clamp down
"(Reuters) - Morgan Stanley (,) lifted its performance goals on Thursday after beating Wall Street estimates by a wide margin, the latest sign that Chief Executive James Gorman's strategic vision for the bank is bearing fruit. ,In a presentation, Morgan Stanley set the bar higher for expense controls, returns on equity and wealth management profits over the next two years and beyond. ,Analysts cheered the new targets, after repeatedly asking management when Morgan Stanley might upgrade them, since the bank was routinely meeting previous goals. ,Investors cheered the news, with Morgan Stanley shares up 7%. ,The bank posted its presentation after reporting a fourth-quarter profit beat that showed most of its businesses flourishing. ,Bond trading, underwriting and investment management each produced much higher revenue, with M&A advisory being the only area to report a meaningful decline. ,Overall, Morgan Stanley's profit jumped 46%, to $2.09 billion, or $1.30 per share, from $1.36 billion, or 80 cents per share, a year earlier. (,) ,Analysts had expected a profit of 99 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. ,The bank's net revenue rose 27% to $10.9 billion. It set new records for annual profit and revenue, and met or exceeded full-year performance targets Gorman laid out last January. ,Since taking over a decade ago, the 61-year-old CEO has transformed Morgan Stanley from a Wall Street firm heavily weighted in money-losing trading businesses into a more balanced bank. He was the driving force behind Morgan Stanley's decision to acquire Smith Barney, and made wealth management the cornerstone of his plan to stabilize revenue. ,Morgan Stanley's stock has risen about 79% during Gorman's tenure, while the S&P 500 Banks index .SPXBK and S&P 500 , have nearly tripled. ,During an analyst call on Thursday, Gorman described the first five years of his tenure as a clean-up period after the financial crisis, and the second five as a time when he focused on growing businesses without sacrificing profitability. ,Gorman noted that Morgan Stanley's wealth business now generates about three times as much daily revenue as it did five years ago, and its securities business has snatched market share from rivals at a time when industry revenue has shrunk. ,(For a graphic on Morgan Stanley's institutional securites revenue, click here: ,) ,""We have meaningfully and with intent transformed this business into what it is today,"" he said. ""As we execute on the next phase of the firm's journey, the objectives listed here, assuming a normal market environment, should result as a natural consequence."" ,Over the next two years, Gorman wants Morgan Stanley to hit an efficiency ratio of 70-72%. Over the long-term, he is hoping the bank can get to 70% or less. ,That metric, which measures costs relative to revenue, is watched closely by investors as a symbol of whether a company spends wisely. Morgan Stanley met its prior goal of 73% or less in 2019. ,Keeping costs under control will help the bank reach another metric Gorman set for returns on equity (ROE), which shows how profitably a bank uses shareholder funds. ,Morgan Stanley now aims to produce ROE of 13-15% through 2022, and 15-17% after that. Its 11.7% ROE last year was within Gorman's prior targeted range of 10-13%. ,Finally, he now wants the wealth unit to generate a pre-tax profit margin of 28-30% over the next two years, and 30% or more after that. The business's 27.2% margin last year was comfortably within the prior goal of 26-28%. ,On the call, some analysts probed the assumptions behind those figures, asking what might happen if markets collapse. On the other hand, Wells Fargo's Mike Mayo - who has repeatedly pressed management to raise targets - asked why they should not be higher. ,Gorman recalled a time when analysts were skeptical that Morgan Stanley could achieve much lower goals he had set, when its ROE was just 2-4% and its wealth margins were only 10%. He compared them to children in the back of a car asking, ""When are we going to get there?"" ,""What I've always tried to do with these targets is set a range where the bottom of the range is what we should be able to deliver in all normal circumstances,"" he said. ""The top of the range is obviously a little more sporty."" ,Morgan Stanley is the last of the major U.S. banks to report results this week, with JPMorgan Chase & Co (,), Citigroup Inc (,) and Bank of America Corp (,) posting similar trends in their Wall Street businesses. ,However, its performance came in a stark contrast to its closest rival, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (,), which reported a profit decline on Thursday. Goldman is now in the middle of its own strategic turnaround, expanding into areas like consumer banking and corporate cash management to make profits less volatile.

"(Reuters) - The U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA) that was passed by the U.S. Senate today modernizes the 26-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement that has been blamed for  hollowing out the U.S. manufacturing sector.  ,The bill is expected to be quickly signed by U.S. President Donald Trump this week, but the trade deal still needs to be approved by Canada's Parliament before it goes into effect.  ,The new agreement makes mostly modest changes, and will leave more than $1.2 trillion in North American trade flows largely unchanged. While the deal has been forecast to create 176,000 U.S. jobs over 15 years, it is not expected to bring lost factory jobs back to the United States from Mexico in coming years.  ,The bill passed on Thursday is identical to the bill voted in by the House of Representatives on Dec. 19, after swift approval by multiple Senate committees in recent days.  ,Here are some of the key changes to the pact:  ,One of the biggest changes requires increased North American content in cars and trucks built in the region, to 75% from 62.5% under NAFTA, with new mandates to use North American steel and aluminum. ,And 40-45% of a vehicle's value must come from ""high wage"" areas paying workers at least $16 an hour, namely the United States and Canada, a provision aimed at slowing the industry's migration to low-wage Mexico. Vehicles that fail to meet the standard will be subject to U.S. tariffs. ,The rules put some foreign-brand automakers in the United States at a disadvantage, by forcing them to invest in new U.S. or Canadian plants for high-value components such as engines and transmissions.  ,Canada will provide U.S. dairy farmers access to about 3.5 percent of its $16 billion annual domestic dairy market. In exchange, the United States backed off efforts to force Canada to scrap its longstanding ""supply management"" system, which maintains high dairy tariffs. ,The United States will be able to increase exports of some milk products like skim milk and milk proteins to Canada.  ,The United States also gets tariff-free access to Canada for 57,000 tonnes of chicken by year six of the deal, and access for 10 million dozen U.S. eggs and egg equivalents. ,To encourage Mexican workers to unionize and to drive up wages, the deal allows the United States and Canada to convene panels of international labor experts to hear complaints if  Mexican factories are denying them the freedom to organize and collectively bargain. ,If such violations are found and remedial actions are not taken, it allows the complaining country to rescind tariff-free access for the offending facility's products, among other penalties. ,COPYRIGHT, DIGITAL TRADE, E-COMMERCE ,Copyright protection will extend for 70 years past an author's death, in line with current U.S. law. In Canada, copyright generally extends for 50 years past death. ,Customs and other charges on digital products such as music, games, videos, and e-books, will be prohibited, and countries prohibited from requiring localized computer facilities to store data. ,The deal protects internet platforms from liability related to third-party information that they publish. ,Mexico's and Canada's thresholds for imports subject to duty collection and customs declaration will double to $100 and $30.25, respectively. The increases will benefit online retailers shipping across the region's borders and small businesses importing small orders. ,The deal will phase out much of the old investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) protections, which gave North American firms operating in a neighboring country the option to challenge local government decisions at an international tribunal.  ,Under the new deal, the ISDS tribunal would only be an option for firms disputing the Mexican government over a small number of issues, such as state expropriation of assets or discrimination against foreign entities, and firms operating in a handful of industries.  ,The deal aims to hold down drug prices by limiting some patent protections for pharmaceuticals. Eliminated from the original text is a required 10-year data exclusivity period for biotech medicines, which U.S. Democrats feared would prolong higher prices for some of the priciest drugs. ,The deal also removes a provision that would require parties to confirm patents for new uses of known drugs, combating a process called ""patent evergreening"" that blocks generic competition. ,The deal does not include any provisions to limit climate change, disappointing environmental groups. ,But the changes require each of the three countries to adhere to the 1987 Montreal Protocol to eliminate ozone-depleting substances.  ,The text also requires compliance with international agreements on endangered species, wetlands, Antarctic marine life, whaling and tuna fisheries.

"(Reuters) - McAfee LLC told Reuters on Thursday it has hired Peter Leav, the former CEO of BMC Software, as its new CEO, replacing Chris Young, who created the cyber security company in its current form by carving it out of Intel Corp four years ago.  ,The move gives McAfee the option of pursuing an initial public offering with a new leader. It has also considered deals in the sector, including potentially merging with NortonLifeLock Inc. ,Young will become a senior advisor at buyout firm TPG, which acquired a majority stake in McAfee from Intel Corp in 2016 in a deal which valued the company at $4.2 billion, including debt. Young will work with TPG on new technology investments. ,During Young's tenure, the company saw mid-single digit revenue growth, according to a person familiar with the matter. ,Leav previously served as president and CEO of BMC, a business software firm, for three years. He left in 2019, a few months after the completion of private equity firm KKR & Co's $8.5-billion buyout of the company. He will start as McAfee CEO on Feb. 3.  ,""Peter has exactly the right mix of experience and expertise to lead McAfee in its next phase of growth,"" said TPG co-CEO and McAfee Chairman Jon Winkelried.  ,The global cyber security industry was valued at $116.5 billion in 2018, and is forecast to grow around 11% per year through to 2025, as the number of cyber security threats continues to rise, according to research firm Grand View Research. ,TPG has yet to make a decision on the timing or manner of its exit from McAfee, according to a person familiar with the matter. ,In the last few years, McAfee has managed to grow its main cyber security software business, which focuses on consumers, through price increases, new partner programs and good retention rates, according credit ratings agency Moody's Investors Service Inc. This growth has been partially offset, however, by weakness in its business of serving other companies, which remains competitive, according to Moody's. ,In November, NortonLifeLock, previously called Symantec, sold its enterprise business serving other companies to chip maker Broadcom Inc for $10.7 billion.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - He listed familiar grievances, praised and criticized his guests, and seemed to blow off some steam. ,U.S. President Donald Trump signed a trade deal with China on Wednesday at a White House event that was part formal ceremony and part political theater. ,Trump's trade war with China has been a centerpiece of much of his presidency, and the ceremony to seal a ""Phase 1"" deal - held at the White House rather than a more neutral location for the two sides - was a victory lap of sorts. ,The Republican president relished the moment and the stage  but also used it to rail against impeachment, banter with visiting chief executives, and lambaste China for past sins even as its representatives stood stoically nearby. ,A former reality television star, Trump is known for stage managing his events closely, and this one was no exception. ,The president chose to sign the agreement himself, despite the fact that his counterpart President Xi Jinping sent a lower level official to represent the Chinese side.  ,The ceremony started with requisite pomp in the formal East Room, packed with guests and journalists from both countries, as the president paraded down a central aisle with Chinese Vice Premier Liu He while a military band played ""Hail to the Chief."" ,Trump then began his remarks from a podium on the stage, reading from a Teleprompter.  ,That did not last long. ,While the vice premier and three other Chinese officials stood to his right, Trump strayed from his remarks with criticism of the ""hoax"" that he calls impeachment and of the way in which U.S.-China trade was handled in the past. ,""Since China joined the World Trade Organization two decades ago, we have racked up nearly $5 trillion - the Vice Premier, I hope he's not listening to this - in trade deficits, lost millions and millions of manufacturing jobs, and saw tens of thousands of factories close,"" Trump said. ,The president added later: ""They were not doing things that they were supposed to be.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is touting the U.S.-China Phase 1 trade deal's dispute settlement and enforcement mechanism as the major difference between the 86-page agreement unveiled on Tuesday and past pledges by Beijing to change its trade practices. ,But the final result of any dispute that prompts new U.S. tariffs to be slapped back on Chinese goods could tear the whole trade deal apart, according to the text of the agreement released on Thursday. ,U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer insisted on a strong enforcement mechanism ""with real teeth"" to hold China to its Phase 1 pledges to protect American intellectual property, curb the forced transfer of U.S. technology to Chinese firms and boost purchases of U.S. goods and services by some $200 billion over two years. ,The teeth in the mechanism are a familiar Trump administration tool: the imposition of tariffs in proportion to damage caused by any non-compliance. ,But according to the text, if the offending party disagrees with such a result, its only recourse is to quit the agreement. There are no provisions for appeal or levying retaliatory tariffs. ,""If the Party Complained Against considers that the action of the Complaining Party was taken in bad faith, the remedy is to withdraw from this Agreement by providing written notice of withdrawal to the Complaining Party,"" the text states. ,A Trump administration official said that ""bad faith"" and ""good faith"" were undefined in the agreement, but actions would be based on facts and economic impact.  ,Under that scenario, an enforcement action could cause the agreement to collapse, China trade experts say. Some other U.S. trade deals, such as the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, employ third-party arbitration panels to settle disputes. ,""The Phase 1 enforcement mechanism is very simplistic. It's basically a one or a zero - an on or an off,"" said Scott Kennedy, an expert on Chinese economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ,""One side will risk scuppering the entire thing over an implementation dispute,"" he added. ,90-DAY CONSULTATIONS ,Trump administration officials insist that they have set up a robust process for resolving disputes, with each country opening an enforcement office to field and review complaints about compliance. ,Those grievances will be aired through a series of consultations with escalating levels of officials over a roughly 90-day period before penalties can be levied. ,The two countries have also agreed to revive regular trade  consultations, with monthly working-level meetings, quarterly deputy meetings and semi-annual ministerial level conferences, similar to past U.S.-China economic dialogues.   ,""Ultimately it's the president who is going to make the call"" on whether a problem is big enough to levy tariffs, said Derek Scissors, a China scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. ""If they're making the purchases, he's likely to be happy."" ,Lighthizer acknowledged on Tuesday that the dispute settlement plan was untested, telling reporters that the agreement ""will work if China wants it to work."" ,""Do I think we'll be tested and have cases? Yeah, absolutely,"" he said. ""And we'll find out. If the dispute settlement process works, we're going to be OK, and if it doesn't, we won't."" ,But he said he would use the process to enforce the agreement ""to the letter.""

"BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China will boost purchases of U.S. goods and services by $200 billion over two years in exchange for the rolling back of some tariffs under an initial trade deal signed by the world's two largest economies, defusing an 18-month row that has hit global growth. ,Key world stock market indexes climbed to record highs after the deal was signed on Wednesday in Washington, but later stalled on concerns it may not ease trade tensions for long, with numerous thorny issues still unresolved.   ,While acknowledging the need for further negotiations with China to solve a host of other problems, President Donald Trump hailed the agreement as a win for the U.S. economy and his administration's trade policies. ,""Together, we are righting the wrongs of the past and delivering a future of economic justice and security for American workers, farmers and families,"" Trump said in rambling remarks at the White House alongside U.S. and Chinese officials on Wednesday. ,Chinese Vice Premier Liu He read a letter from President Xi Jinping in which the Chinese leader praised the deal as a sign the two countries could resolve their differences with dialogue.  ,""While markets seemed to take this deal as a risk-on signal, we should all be aware that headlines about trade, particularly U.S. China trade, are going to be a constant feature of 2020,"" said Hannah Anderson, Global Markets Strategist, J.P. Morgan Asset Management in Hong Kong. ,The centerpiece of the deal is a pledge by China to purchase at least an additional $200 billion worth of U.S. farm products and other goods and services over two years, above a baseline of $186 billion in purchases in 2017, the White House said. ,Commitments include $54 billion in additional energy purchases, $78 billion in additional manufacturing purchases, $32 billion more in farm products, and $38 billion in services, according to deal documents released by the White House and China's Finance Ministry. ,Liu said Chinese companies would buy $40 billion in U.S. agricultural products annually over the next two years ""based on market conditions"" which may dictate timing of purchases in any given year.  ,Beijing had balked at committing to buy set amounts of U.S. farm goods earlier, and has inked new soybean contracts with Brazil since the trade war started.  ,Liu later said the deal would not affect ""third parties' interests"", apparently in reference to deals made with other suppliers of farm goods.  ,Chinese companies will import U.S. agricultural goods according to consumers' need, and demand and supply in the market, Liu told reporters, according to CCTV. ,Although the deal could be a boost to U.S. farmers, automakers and heavy equipment manufacturers, some analysts question China's ability to replace imports from other trading partners with more shipments from the United States. ,The deal does not end retaliatory tariffs on American farm exports, makes farmers ""increasingly reliant"" on Chinese state-controlled purchases, and does not address ""big structural changes,"" Michelle Erickson-Jones, a wheat farmer and spokeswoman for Farmers for Free Trade, said in a statement. ,Oil prices rose, helped by expectations of more Chinese purchases of U.S. oil and gas. ,Trump, who has embraced an ""America First"" policy aimed at rebalancing global trade in favor of U.S. companies and workers, said China had pledged action to confront the problem of pirated or counterfeited goods and said the deal included strong protection of intellectual property rights. ,Washington's insistence on enforcement mechanisms ""with real teeth"" could tear the deal apart if any tariffs are re-imposed for non-compliance. ,U.S. Speaker of the House of Representative Nancy Pelosi said Trump's China strategy had ""inflicted deep, long-term damage to American agriculture and rattled our economy in exchange for more of the promises that Beijing has been breaking for years,"" in a statement. ,Earlier, top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told Fox News the agreement would add 0.5 percentage point to U.S. gross domestic product growth in both 2020 and 2021. ,Aviation industry sources said Boeing Co was expected to win a major order for wide-body jets from China, including its 787 or 777-9 models, or a mixture of both.  ,The deal touted new wins for U.S. companies looking to access China's $40 trillion financial sector, but many of the changes were already in the works with Beijing stepping up the pace of opening up in the past year. ,China's central bank said Chinese financial institutions are completely capable of coping with foreign competition and it will strengthen financial supervisions as the sector is freed up. ,The Phase 1 deal canceled planned U.S. tariffs on Chinese-made cellphones, toys and laptop computers and halved the tariff rate to 7.5% on about $120 billion worth of other Chinese goods, including flat-panel televisions, Bluetooth headphones and footwear. ,But it will leave in place 25% tariffs on a $250-billion array of Chinese industrial goods and components used by U.S. manufacturers, and China's retaliatory tariffs on over $100 billion in U.S. goods. ,Market turmoil and reduced investment tied to the trade war would likely cut global growth in 2019 to its lowest rate since the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the International Monetary Fund said in October. ,Trump, who has been touting the Phase 1 deal as a pillar of his 2020 re-election campaign, said he would agree to remove the remaining tariffs once the two sides had negotiated a ""Phase 2"" agreement. ,""We've already begun discussions on a Phase 2 deal,"" Vice President Mike Pence said in a Fox Business Network interview.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co (,) aims to announce roughly one $1 billion to $5 billion deal every quarter in 2020, its chief financial officer told Reuters, as the U.S. drugmaker looks to build up its pipeline of future products.  ,It will focus largely on earlier stage opportunities across key therapeutic areas including oncology, pain, immunology, and neurology, CFO John Smiley told Reuters in an interview at the JP Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco earlier this week.  ,Eli Lilly has been on a deal-making spree in recent years in a bid to increase products and sales in core franchises as older blockbuster medicines, such as diabetes treatment Humalog, face generic competition and pressure to lower prices. ,Last week, it announced a $1.1 billion deal to buy dermatology products maker Dermira Inc (,). With the purchase, Lilly will acquire Dermira's experimental treatment for atopic dermatitis, a serious form of eczema, which is in late-stage testing, as well as an approved medicated cloth to treat excessive armpit sweating. ,""We are looking at Dermira-like opportunities targeting assets in the $1 billion to $5 billion range,"" Smiley said. ""We'd like to be doing something in the range of one per quarter or so."" ,In 2018 and 2019, it announced several deals for cancer companies, including an $8 billion acquisition of Loxo Oncology. U.S. regulators in 2018 approved Vitrakvi, Loxo's first commercial medicine, which treats a wide variety of cancers triggered by a rare genetic mutation.   ,In a presentation to investors this week, Lilly Chief Executive David Ricks said most of its deals will be in the cancer space, but that other therapeutic areas remain of strong interest as well.  ,While the company is still looking at late-stage assets, Smiley said the most opportunity for shareholders is in drugs  in earlier stages of development.  ,Deals could include licensing agreements, outright acquisitions, or other structures, he added. ,In its most recent earnings call, Lilly forecast a higher-than-expected profit for 2020, citing growing demand for its newer medicines including diabetes drug Trulicity and Taltz for psoriasis and other related autoimmune diseases. ,However, sales of Trulicity and other newer medicines have been crimped by high rebates and discounts drugmakers pay to middlemen, such as pharmacy benefit managers, in order to make sure patients have access to their products.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - NBCUniversal's new Peacock streaming service will offer free and $5-per-month options with advertising to try to win customers for its belated entry into the online video wars, the company announced on Thursday. ,NBCUniversal parent Comcast Corp is betting that viewers who have abandoned traditional pay TV and are weary of being asked to open their wallets for multiple streaming services will embrace a no-cost alternative with commercials.  ,Peacock will debut for Comcast customers on April 15 and across the United States on July 15. The company plans to expand the service to other countries over time. ,Executives unveiled their offering at a celebrity-studded presentation to investors inside Studio 8H in New York's 30 Rockefeller Plaza where long-running sketch comedy show ""Saturday Night Live"" is broadcast.  ,Actor and writer Tina Fey, who is creating a comedy series for Peacock, appeared onstage to highlight the breadth of programming to be available, from next-day access to current NBC series to the entire catalog of shows such as ""Cheers,"" ""30 Rock,"" ""The Office"" and ""Saturday Night Live"", as well as classic movies from ""Jaws"" to ""Jurassic Park."" ,""Tonight Show"" host Jimmy Fallon said his show and ""Late Night with Seth Meyers"" would be available to some customers of Peacock - which was named after NBC's longtime logo - more than three hours before they air on traditional television.

Fallon quipped onstage. ,NBCUniversal said it expects to reach 30 million to 35 million active Peacock accounts by 2024. ,""We believe affordability will be critical as more subscription sources are launched, leading to bigger customer bills,"" said NBCUniversal Chairman Steve Burke.  ,Peacock will be one of the last entries in the crowded streaming landscape, dominated by Netflix Inc and including Walt Disney Co's Disney+, Apple Inc's Apple TV+, Amazon.com Inc's Amazon Prime Video, Hulu (controlled by Disney), and ViacomCBS Inc's CBS All Access. In May, AT&T Inc's WarnerMedia will launch its new entrant, HBO Max. ,The majority of those services make money from subscription revenue, but Comcast opted to sell ads to run with the programming and offer a service at no charge to consumers.  ,""It is impossible to overstate the power of free,"" said Linda Yaccarino, chairman of NBCUniversal advertising and partnerships. ""Zero dollars means zero barriers between advertisers and consumers."" ,Peacock will include 10 advertising formats, such as so-called shoppable ads that let viewers purchase products, but will limit the amount to 5 minutes or less per hour, the ""lightest ad load in the entire industry,"" Yaccarino said.  ,The average commercial time per hour topped 14 minutes on broadcast and cable networks last year, according to Nielsen. ,State Farm, Target Corp and Unilever PLC are among the early advertisers on the service, which will bring in ""hundreds of millions"" of dollars in initial advertising revenue, NBCUniversal said in a statement.  ,Peacock will also feature ""binge ads,"" where a viewer watches three episodes of a show and a sponsor can make the fourth episode ad-free.  ,NBCUniversal hopes to lure advertisers through the vast amounts of data it can use to target commercials based on viewers' interests, including data from Comcast's cable TV set-top boxes. ,Peacock Free will be offered nationwide and include more than 7,500 hours of programming including classic NBC series  and news and sports including the Olympics.  ,Peacock Premium, which will cost $5 per month and include ads, will feature more than 15,000 hours of content including Peacock originals and additional sports.

"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's property investment hit a two-year low in December even as it grew at a solid pace in 2019, adding to recent signs of a slackening in the sector and suggested Beijing might need to offer more stimulus to stabilize a cooling economy.      ,Real estate investment, which mainly focuses on the residential sector but includes commercial and office space, increased 9.9% in 2019 from the year-earlier period, down from 10.2% in the first 11 months but still outpaced a 9.5% gain in 2018. ,In December alone, year-on-year growth slowed to 7.3% from 8.4% in November, the weakest pace since December 2017, according to Reuters calculations based on data released by National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) on Friday. ,The reading was in line with other activity data out on Friday that showed the world's second-largest economy grew 6.1% in 2019, the slowest in 29 years, and was likely helped by looser monetary policy as it gave developers relatively easier access to credit.  ,New bank lending in China hit a record of 16.81 trillion yuan ($2.44 trillion) in 2019, while China's central bank has announced eight cuts in banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR) since early 2018, freeing up more funds and driving down lending costs. ,""There was some slowdown in December but we don't need to be too concerned with property because things are improving on the financing side,"" said Yang Yewei, a Beijing-based analyst with Southwest Securities, who noted an increase in mortgages in December. ,Funds raised by China's property developers grew 7.6% in 2019 year-on-year, NBS data showed, faster than the 7% pace in the first eleven months. ,Chinese property developers kicked off the new year with a strong pipeline of bond issuance, in particular for long-tenor notes, taking advantage of easier regulatory approvals and robust market demand. ,But analysts say investment in actual construction has slowed notably as developers exercised caution, although they appear still eager to bid for land.  ,Measured by floor area, new construction starts rose 7.4% in December from a year earlier, recovering from a 2.9% decline in November when it hit the worst level seen in more than two years, according to Reuters calculations. ,Land sales by floor area in 300 major cities tracked by China Index Academy fell 1% on-year in 2019, while transaction value surged 19%, providing a much needed boost to local government purse strings. ,The government is keen to defuse housing bubbles after years of supercharged price gains. However, since the real estate sector remains a key pillar of the economy, any more weakness could influence the pace and scope of fresh stimulus measures expected from Beijing this year. ,Property sales by floor area, a major indicator of demand, fell 0.1% in 2019 from a year earlier, marking the first full-year decline in five years since the last downturn in 2014, when it slumped 7.6%, the NBS data showed on Friday.    ,In December, they fell 1.7%, compared with a modest increase of 1.1% in the previous month, ending five months of consecutive growth, Reuters calculated from official data. ,Analysts say a continued downturn in sales on the back of government controls to curb speculation will constrain price growth in coming months, dampening developers' appetite for front-loading construction. ,Data on Thursday showed China's new home prices grew at their weakest pace in 17 months in December, with broader curbs on the sector continuing to cool the market in a further blow to the sputtering economy. ,Some analysts say the government could potentially dial back stimulus when economic growth stabilizes in order to lower debt risks.  ,""It is likely that the government could take the chance of an economic warm-up to consolidate local government finance and continue the property market control, which might set an up-limit for GDP growth in this year,"" J.P.

"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's annual aluminum production fell for the first time in 10 years in 2019, official data showed on Friday, hit by softer demand amid the Sino-U.S. trade row and large-scale smelter outages. ,Aluminum output dropped to 35.04 million tonnes last year, down 0.9% from record levels a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) reported. ,China's full-year aluminum output last fell in 2009, according to annual data on the NBS website, although estimates from the International Aluminum Institute show production rising every year this century. ,The drop in annual output came as major smelters suffered unplanned outages from August. Top producer China Hongqiao Group (,) closed some lines because of flooding in Shandong province and Xinfa Group had an explosion at a site in Xinjiang. ,But it also highlights the impact of China's economic slowdown on the sector, ending a decade of break-neck expansion that saw China increase its dominance of global aluminum production and consumption. ,China's annual aluminum consumption was set to fall for the first time in 30 years in 2019, research house Antaike said in November.  ,December aluminum output came in at 3.04 million tonnes, the NBS said, up 4.9% from the previous month thanks to a wave of restarts at smelters. It was down 0.7% from the all-time high hit in December 2018 but still the second-highest monthly figure on record. ,Output averaged about 98,000 tonnes per day last month, according to Reuters calculations, up from around 96,600 tonnes per day in November. ,Almost 1 million tonnes of annual aluminum smelting capacity restarted in December, mostly in western regions such as Qinghai and Xinjiang, said Lu Chen, a Beijing-based analyst for CM Group. ,The restarts were due to a combination of higher prices and completed repairs, said Lu, who expects January output to rise following the start-up of Henan Shenhuo's new plant in Yunnan on Dec. 31 and the second phase of Yunnan Aluminum's Heqing smelter earlier this month. ,Lu forecasts China will bring a total of 2 million tonnes of additional capacity on line in 2020. ,Output of 10 nonferrous metals - including copper, aluminum, lead, zinc and nickel - came in at 5.31 million tonnes in December.

"BEIJING (Reuters) - Crude steel production in China climbed to a record just shy of 1 billion tonnes in 2019, boosted by a resilient property market and robust demand as Beijing beefed up infrastructure spending in a bid to weather a slowdown in economic growth.  ,The world's biggest steelmaker churned out 996.34 million tonnes of crude steel in 2019, up 8.3% from 2018's previous record, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Friday.  ,In December, China's steel production surged 12% year-on-year to 84.27 million tonnes, the highest since August, according to the statistics bureau.

"HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG (,) is set to take a 20% stake in Chinese electric vehicle battery maker Guoxuan High-tech Co Ltd, two sources told Reuters, as the German firm accelerates its electric push into the world's largest auto market. ,The deal would mark Volkswagen's first direct ownership in a Chinese battery maker and comes as the Wolfsburg-based automaker strives to meet a goal of selling 1.5 million new energy vehicles (NEVs) a year in China by 2025, including plug-in hybrid cars. ,The top foreign automaker in China plans to acquire the stake in Shenzhen-listed Guoxuan via a discounted private share placement in the coming weeks, the two sources with knowledge of the matter said. Based on Guoxuan's market capitalization of $2.8 billion, a 20% stake in the company at present is worth about $560 million.  ,The deal's details have been mostly finalized and the two firms are waiting for new Chinese regulatory rules on private share placements that will provide a more flexible pricing mechanism and shorter lock-up periods for majority shareholders, said one of the people, speaking on condition of anonymity. ,After the stake purchase, Volkswagen will become the battery maker's second-largest shareholder with a 20% stake, behind Zhuhai Guoxuan Trading Ltd, a firm controlled by Guoxuan's founder Li Zhen, which currently holds 25%.  ,Shares in Guoxuan surged by their maximum 10% on the news on Friday to trade at their highest level since March last year.  ,Volkswagen declined to comment. Guoxuan and the China Securities Regulatory Commission did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters. ,An executive at Guoxuan's board secretary's office told the government-backed Securities Times newspaper it had not yet received news about a stake acquisition. ,Guoxuan is among a swathe of mid-tier Chinese battery makers behind CATL and BYD.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - As Google-parent Alphabet Inc became on Thursday the fourth U.S. company to top a market value of more than $1 trillion, some funds holding its shares are wondering whether now is the time to cash in on the stock's extraordinary gains. ,Shares of the Internet search giant are up nearly 17% over the last three months, outpacing a broader rally in the S&P 500 index over the same period by 6 percentage points. ,Short interest in the stock, a measure of how many investors are betting on a price decline, is at 1%, near a 52-week high for the company and higher than competitors such as Microsoft and Facebook, according to Refinitv data. ,Alphabet joins Apple, Amazon.com and Microsoft as the only U.S. companies to hit $1 trillion in market value. ,""Google is a stock that won't get you fired,"" said Kevin Landis, a portfolio manager at Firsthand Funds who hasn't added to his current Alphabet position since the first quarter of 2019. ""Will I be able to double my money in this stock from here? I'm not sure about that."" ,Alphabet's shares are among a small group of stocks found in the top holdings of both mutual funds and hedge funds, two types of institutions whose investing styles tend to be markedly different, a Goldman Sachs analysis showed. That could leave it exposed to volatile price swings if sentiment suddenly changes.  ,Despite those concerns, many investors are finding it hard to say goodbye. The 28% climb in Alphabet and the performance of other technology and tech-related stocks helped money managers post big gains in 2019, making it difficult for many to justify cutting their exposure even as they fret over the implications of its run-up.  ,Ernesto Ramos, portfolio manager of the BMO Large-Cap Growth Fund, has held onto his shares, betting that Alphabet's exposure to online advertising will eventually justify its above-average valuation. Alphabet trades at 26.6 times future earnings, compared with 18.5 for the S&P 500.  ,Scott Goginsky, a portfolio manager of the Biondo Focus fund, has held off adding to a longstanding position over the last year, concerned that the company's costs are likely to increase due to its efforts to pre-empt any additional regulatory measures from Washington. That could cut into the margins of businesses like YouTube if it needs to hire additional workers to vet user-posted content, he said. ,Alphabet is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Feb. 3. In its latest report, the company missed analysts' estimates for third-quarter profit by about $1.7 billion, though it beat revenue expectations. That news did little to dent investors' bullishness on the company: Alphabet's stock retreated briefly on the report, only to resume its climb several days later. ,Bearish investors, however, can point to Amazon.com, which saw its market value fall below $1 trillion after its streak of record profits ended in July. Shares of the company are down nearly 7% over the last six months, compared with a 10% gain in the S&P 500 overall.  ",Technology News,1/16/2020 21:23,Which company just hit $1 trillion? Google it.

That was the second round, with the firm having previously raised $500 million in 2017. ,A new deal giving Temasek and Trustbridge a majority stake would likely mean that WeWork China would go through a down round - a fall in valuation following a new investment if the proposal got passed - but could significantly ease the financial burden on WeWork and SoftBank.  ,They added that the discussions were at an early stage and a deal was not certain.  ,SoftBank, Temasek and WeWork declined to comment. Trustbridge did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  ,The larger WeWork group is undergoing a broad restructuring after it was thrown a $9.5 billion lifeline by SoftBank following a failed public offering and the ouster of founder Adam Neumann.  ,However, SoftBank's plan to secure $3 billion from Japan's three biggest banks have stalled, likely complicating its rescue package for WeWork, Reuters has reported.  ,WeWork China has set out ambitious revenue goals for 2020, Reuters reported last month, even though it faces staff cutbacks and weak occupancy numbers at its properties across China. ,In 2018, WeWork China generated $99.5 million in revenue, according to WeWork's IPO prospectus.  ,WeWork's woes have had a ripple effect across the sector, impacting the likes of UCommune, WeWork China's rival, which is trying to launch an initial public offering.  ,Citigroup Inc and Credit Suisse Group AG walked away from underwriting UCommune's IPO because they decided they could not deliver the offering at a previously discussed valuation. ,UCommune has now tapped little-known U.S. investment bank Benchmark Company LLC to launch its listing, Reuters reported earlier this month.

But such distractions tend to be short-lived nowadays, with investors getting back to central bank-watching swiftly.  ,Rate-setters in many countries are about to hold their first policy meetings of 2020 - in Japan on Monday and Tuesday, Canada on Wednesday, Norway and the euro zone on Thursday. On Friday, China sets loan prime rates. In emerging markets, Indonesia and Malaysia bear watching on Wednesday - will they follow Turkey and South Africa by easing policy? ,Japan, Canada, Norway and the European Central Bank (ECB) are not expected to make any changes, while it is unlikely China will act again so soon after its early-January reserve ratio cut for banks. The ECB, however, will launch its first strategy review since 2003 to rethink an inflation goal that has not been met for seven years. ,Asset manager Pictet reckons at current prices, global stock markets have already priced over $2 trillion in central bank stimulus this year.

On Tuesday, he gets a platform to express his views, speaking at the Davos World Economic Forum.  ,While signing the Phase 1 deal with China, Trump already griped at having to ""pay for our money"" in a swipe at the euro zone's negative borrowing costs. He also blames the ""too high"" dollar for the huge U.S. current account deficit. A currency war risk therefore may not be too remote, especially in an election year. And remember, the Treasury already lists Switzerland, Germany, Italy and Ireland as suspected currency ""manipulators"" - all have trade surpluses with the United States. ,Trump will not be short of sparring opportunities at Davos - some 53 heads of state are to show up in the Alpine resort, , including Germany's Angela Merkel. There will be 35 finance and 30 trade ministers. And given the green focus of this year's summit, 17-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg will attend.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Thursday approved a revamp of the 26-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement that includes tougher rules on labor and automotive content but leaves $1.2 trillion in annual U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade flows largely unchanged. ,The legislation to implement the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement passed on an 89-10 bipartisan vote, sending the measure to President Donald Trump for him to sign into law.  ,The Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives passed the legislation on Dec. 19 after hammering out changes to ensure better enforcement of labor rights and tighter environmental rules during months of often contentious negotiations with the Trump administration. ,The Senate vote came a day after Trump signed a long-awaited Phase 1 trade deal with China, and shortly before the Senate formally began the impeachment trial of Trump on charges that he abused his power.  ,The U.S. S&P 500 stock index hit the 3,300 mark on Thursday for the first time, buoyed by the two trade deals, solid retail sales and upbeat Morgan Stanley earnings. ,U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Trump's efforts to rebalance U.S. ties with its major trading partners were bearing fruit, and boosting U.S. economic growth. ,""This historic agreement not only modernizes and rebalances our trade relationship with Canada and Mexico, but it promotes economic growth, creates jobs, and provides crucial certainty for farmers, workers and manufacturers,"" he said in a statement. ,On Wednesday, Mnuchin told Fox News that interim trade deal with China and passage of USMCA would boost growth of the U.S. gross domestic product by 50 to 75 basis points.   ,Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Thursday called the deal's approval good news for the Mexican economy, and predicted it would jump start new investments. ,Canada still needs to approve the deal before it can take effect and replace NAFTA. It was signed by the leaders of the United States, Mexico and Canada in September 2018. ,Trump made renegotiating NAFTA a centerpiece of his 2016 election campaign, calling it ""the worst trade deal ever made"" and blaming it for the loss of thousands of American factory jobs to low-wage Mexico.  ,He had threatened to cancel NAFTA outright unless Congress acted to approve the replacement deal, sparking uncertainty among business owners and putting a damper on new investment.  ,The AFL-CIO union federation, which represents some 12.5 million workers across the United States, estimates that some 851,700 U.S. jobs were lost to Mexico because of NAFTA.  ,The U.S. goods trade deficit with Mexico was $80.7 billion in 2018, compared with a $1.7 billion surplus in 1993, thanks in part to U.S. companies moving manufacturing south of the border. ,But NAFTA also quadrupled trade among the United States, Canada and Mexico, sending it to $1.2 trillion a year by 2017, and knitting together supply chains across the continent. ,Industry groups hailed the trade agreement and said it would provide sorely needed certainty to revive investment flows. ,U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said the agreement would set ""the new gold standard"" for all future trade agreements with its strong, enforceable labor and environmental stands, digital provisions and rules against market distorting subsidies and currency manipulation. ,Canada's parliament does not return to session until Jan. 27, so the scheduling of a vote there remains unclear. But USMCA is expected to see little resistance in Canada, as Conservatives have said they would back the deal negotiated earlier by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal-dominated government. ,""The implementing legislation will be a top priority when Parliament resumes later this month. We hope that all parliamentarians from all parties will support its swift passage,"" Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said in a statement. ,Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, speaking on the Senate floor, called the vote ""a big bipartisan win,"" . ,Republican Senator Joni Ernst told Fox Business Network that she expected Trump to hold a signing ceremony next week.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard expounded on what might comprise a ""material reassessment"" of the economic outlook, the Treasury yield curve, the central bank's framework review and more in a Reuters interview. ,Following are excerpts from the Jan. 14 discussion with him at the St. Louis Fed: ,Q - Interest rates are now on hold until what Chairman Jerome Powell called a ""material reassessment"" of the economic outlook. Is the phrase too vague or will it mean roughly the same thing to everyone? ,A - It is big tent language ... I do think it matters that it is not in the statement. The committee did not have to come to a decision to put it in. That probably does mean that different people will have different interpretations. ,Q - What does it mean to you? ,A - One unifying theme is that our preferred measure of inflation ... is only 1.6 percent. That has got to improve. ,Q - And if not? ,A - It is wait and see. We made a large (interest rate) move in 2019 ... I think we will see how much impact we have in the first half of 2020 and probably all the way through 2020 and then we will see where we are. ,Q - What about the bond yield curve? That has been a concern of yours. It is positive but very flat. ,A - If you look at the 90s after the Fed eased policy somewhat the 10 year - 2 year (Treasury bond rate spread) fluctuated between 100 basis points and 0. Fifty would be a good goal. We are at 24. Not quite as steep as you would otherwise think. But we are going in the right direction. ,Q - But you don't want to act further to get more slope now? ,A - No. I am happy to have upward sloping. ,Q - Also, the 5-year, 5-year forward expected inflation rate has improved, which was another worry of yours. ,A - I think we demonstrated some agility to markets during 2019 that we were not going to be rigid ... and I think that is paying some dividends in the form of long-term inflation expectations that are somewhat closer to our inflation target ... It is still below two. It should be above 2…You could argue that inflation perks up this year and markets will price in a little bit higher inflation expectation. ,Q - Why this year? ,A - The fact that we eased substantially in 2019 ... bodes reasonably well for the 2020 economy. It might grow faster than 2019 and it is that kind of dynamic that would lead us back to a better expected inflation environment. ,Q - Seems that if there was any residual doubt at the Fed about lower equilibrium interest rates it has been resolved and the last year represented an acceptance of that new normal. ,A - It was a year where we really came to grips with the idea that we were not going to go to 1990s or 2000s level interest rates in the United States ... Not only did we quit trying to go to those higher levels but we turned around and went the other way. ,Q - Are there financial stability reasons to consider raising rates back at some point? ,A - I just don't see anything right now that is so compelling to say we are in a bubble environment and we have to change monetary policy because of that ... But we are certainly alert. ,Q - The chair has also set ""persistent"" inflation as a benchmark, at least for himself, for raising rates. You agree? ,A - I would like to see us able to stake a claim that we are definitely going to hit the inflation target or exceed the inflation target over a forecast horizon since we have missed on the low side for such a long time ... Ideally you could have a couple of years at higher inflation relative to target and that would average out for the couple years we have been below and that would be a good outcome. ,Q - In terms of maintaining an inflation ""anchor,"" is there a point above 2% where you'd start to worry inflation might no longer be stable? ,A - The idea of the last ten years is that we have been putting too much weight on that. We want inflation low and stable. But not so low and stable that we get into the Japanese situation or the European situation. You have to take some risk with some upside. ,Q - In the ongoing review of different ways to manage inflation, it seems the commentary now coming from the Fed is that none of the more complex approaches, involving promises to fully offset past lower inflation with higher future inflation, are going to be adopted.  ,A - Well I have been concerned that the expectation has been that Moses is going to come down with the commandments chiseled in stone and I don't think that is going to happen ... We could make some changes ... You could give some hints that we are going to press harder in this direction or that direction. But that is probably the maximum you can expect out of this process... It is important we are doing it. It has some potential to improve things. But it is going to be on the margin. ,Q - What do you want to see out of it? ,A - I would like to see strengthening of the ""symmetry"" aspect ... What you'd like to be able to say is that going forward we expect that inflation will be above or below the inflation target with equal probability ... Actionable and more forward looking would be good."" ,Q - When this all got started was it clear that the ability of today's Fed to in effect speak for future policymakers would be such a sticking point?  ,A - It is a very tangible and real issue. You might try to say that we will do certain things and then no one believes you and therefore nothing happens at all and the whole policy falls flat ... These type of expectations plays can fall short and it is very concerning that you not lose credibility through a process like this.

"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican auto parts manufacturers with clients across North America expect a record year after U.S. approval of a trade deal mandating higher regional inputs, but the new rules pose a bigger challenge to carmakers. ,After months of wrangling, U.S. lawmakers on Thursday ratified the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), brokered at the behest of President Donald Trump to replace the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). ,The accord, which Canada's parliament is expected to approve soon, requires automakers to use more local inputs for their cars to qualify for tariff-free trade within North America. ,Over a period of years, automakers must gradually raise local content to 75% of a car's value from 62.5%.

Car sales, output and exports have all fallen and the industry expects them to drop again this year. ,By contrast, the autoparts industry, including Mexico-based Rassini(,) and Nemak(,) and a wealth of foreign suppliers such as Goodyear(,) and Pirelli(,), grew by 2.2% last year. ,INA expects sales in 2020 to surpass $100 billion for the first time, rising to $102 billion from nearly $99 billion. ,USMCA was designed to slow the car industry's exodus from the United States and Canada by requiring 40% of a light vehicle and 45% of a pickup to come from ""high wage"" areas paying workers at least $16 an hour. ,Another challenge for manufacturers: rules requiring use of North American steel and aluminum. ,""It's going to be hard work with our suppliers to meet the new rules, especially the steel and aluminum requirements and the labor content value,"" said Miguel Elizalde, head of the Mexican association of heavy vehicle makers, ANPACT. ,Manufacturers in Mexico are confident they can take advantage of the 55-60% of the market they are not priced out of. ,Still, Kenneth Smith, Mexico's lead trade negotiator from 2017-2018, said the new terms in the USMCA would be onerous for the industry across North America. ,""It's not good for Mexico, for the United States or Canada, because at the end of the day, specialized steels are going to become more expensive for the auto sector,"" he told Reuters. ,But after nearly three years of fraught discussions, Mexico could take comfort from the fact that the United States finally signed off the deal. ,""It's very good news,"" Smith said. ""And it does give added certainty to investors and exporters."" ",Business News,1/17/2020 15:34,Mexican autoparts firms eye fast lane after U.S. backs trade deal

"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China's Sinopec, expected to be the next major Chinese buyer of U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG), is planning to review terms of a potential $16 billion supply deal with Cheniere Energy Inc after a sharp drop in LNG prices, industry officials said. ,That could delay sign-off on a deal that would help Beijing meet ambitious targets it set for U.S. energy purchases in a Phase 1 trade agreement it signed with the United States on Wednesday. ,Sinopec, officially named China Petroleum & Chemical Corp, and Houston-based Cheniere had been expected to sign the 20-year deal once a trade truce was reached between Beijing and Washington. ,However, the LNG market has shifted since news of Sinopec and Cheniere's negotiations became public early last year. In the intervening period, the U.S.-China trade war sapped Chinese purchases of U.S. LNG, and several other gas suppliers, including Qatar, the lowest-cost producer, decided to build new export plants. ,That coming supply would add to an existing glut that has caused gas prices to collapse to their lowest levels in years and could keep them suppressed - giving Sinopec additional leverage with Cheniere. ,Both companies declined to comment. ,A source familiar with the talks said many items needed to be reviewed as U.S. gas prices have more than halved since 2018.   ,""Sinopec is talking to several other U.S. suppliers,"" said a second source. ""It's really not clear at this stage what will come out."" ,The firm, as one of the few state buyers with appetite to sign new multi-year LNG supply deals, also needs to lobby Beijing to remove or rebate a 25% tariff that has made U.S. imports uneconomical in the past year, one of the sources said.   ,""(The deal) will be renegotiated... over delivery terms and price,"" said an industry executive with knowledge of the matter, who declined to be named as the matter is not public. ""It may not be tough, but will take time."" ,Sinopec, which plans to more than double its LNG receiving capacities to 41 million tonnes by 2025, emerged last year as China's biggest spot buyer of LNG, as it is a much smaller purchaser under long-term deals than PetroChina Co Ltd   or China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC). ,Those two firms are committed to other long-term contracts, and therefore much less likely to seek new supply agreements with U.S. exporters. They are also facing slower domestic demand growth and weaker prices, which have led to losses in their LNG import business.  ,State oil firm China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) has already fulfilled its supply needs through existing deals with Cheniere, and is also anticipating new supply from investments in the Russian Arctic and Mozambique, said one trading executive.  ,The prospect of buying U.S. LNG is even more remote for China's so-called second-tier independent gas companies, because they have little access to terminal facilities.   ,""We'll be in close contact with U.S. suppliers, but price is always the key,"" said Frank Li, assistant to the president of private city gas distributor China Gas Holdings. ""For now Russian pipeline gas is cheaper, Qatari gas is cheaper.""  ,A top state-oil trading executive said his level of management had received no internal briefing from the government over what products Beijing had in mind when agreeing the Phase 1 trade deal. ,""We're already under steep pressure to absorb high-cost term supplies ... and as the market is expected to stay over-supplied beyond 2023, why should we sign up to more term deals?"" a CNOOC gas manager said.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job openings recorded their biggest drop in more than four years in November, while hiring increased moderately, suggesting a loss of momentum in the labor market at the tail end of 2019. ,Job openings, a measure of labor demand, tumbled 561,000 to 6.80 million, the Labor Department said in its monthly Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, on Friday. That was the biggest drop since August 2015 and pushed job openings to their lowest level since March 2018. ,Economists said the decline in vacancies and moderate hiring were potentially signaling that employers were throttling back demand for workers. Still, job openings remain relatively high.  ,""The labor market may be starting to lose its shine and may have peaked,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""Anyone holding out for their dream job may have already missed the boat."" ,Vacancies have been trending lower this year since hitting an all-time high of 7.63 million in late 2018. The decline in job openings in November was led by the private sector, which saw a decrease of 520,000 unfilled jobs. The drop in vacancies was concentrated in the retail and construction industries. ,Government job openings fell 42,000 in November.  ,The job openings rate decreased to 4.3% in November from 4.6% in October. Hiring increased to 5.82 million in November from 5.78 million in October. The hiring rate was unchanged at 3.8% in November. ,The sharp drop in job openings suggests job growth will likely not accelerate much after slowing in December. The government reported last week that nonfarm payrolls rose by 145,000 jobs in December, down from November's robust increase of 256,000. ,""We expect the labor market to moderate further in 2020,"" said Sophia Koropeckyj, as senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ""Although net job gains will fall below 100,000 during the year, we no longer expect net job losses during the second half of the year."" ,The number of workers voluntarily quitting their jobs was little changed at 3.5 million in November. The quits rate was 2.3% for the third straight month.  ,The quits rate is viewed by policymakers and economists as a measure of job market confidence. ,About 118,000 workers quit their jobs in the retail sector in November. There were also increases in quits in the wholesale trade and nondurable goods manufacturing industries. ,Layoffs dropped to 1.75 million in November from 1.80 million in October. Layoffs decreased in the federal government. The layoffs rate dipped to 1.1% from 1.2% in October. ",Business News,1/17/2020 15:46,U.S. job openings post biggest drop in more than four years
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding surged to a 13-year high in December as activity increased across the board, suggesting the housing market recovery was back on track amid low mortgage rates, and could help support the longest economic expansion on record. ,There was also some encouraging news on manufacturing, with other data on Friday showing production at factories increasing for a second straight month in December, indicating some stabilization in one of the industries hardest hit by the Trump administration's 18-month trade war with China. ,Though U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He signed a ""Phase 1"" trade deal on Wednesday, a first step toward defusing the trade war, manufacturing is not out of the woods yet. Boeing (,) this month suspended production of its fast-selling 737 MAX jetliner and ripple effects of that decision are already being felt, with a major supplier announcing layoffs last week. ,""The shockingly large rise in home construction is likely to provide an unexpected boost to growth,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania. ""However, the first quarter of 2020 it might be a lot softer."" ,Housing starts jumped 16.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.608 million units last month, the highest level since December 2006. The percentage gain was the largest since October 2016. Groundbreaking activity last month was likely flattered by unseasonably mild weather and probably overstates the health of the housing market.  ,Data for November was revised higher to show homebuilding rising to a pace of 1.375 million units, instead of advancing to a rate of 1.365 million units as previously reported. ,Economists polled by Reuters had forecast housing starts would increase to a pace of 1.375 million units in December. ,The dollar firmed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury debt prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with the main indexes hitting record highs. ,Housing starts soared 40.8% on a year-on-year basis in December. An estimated 1.290 million housing units were started in 2019, up 3.2% compared to 2018.  ,The rise in construction, together with an increase in completions and the inventory of homes under construction, could ease a housing shortage that has constrained sales over the last couple of years. Housing completions increased 5.1% to a rate of 1.277 million units in December. ,Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to plug the inventory gap. The stock of housing under construction rose 2.0% to 1.192 million units, the highest level since March 2007.  ,""It's going to take more than increased construction to completely emerge from the ongoing and historic inventory shortage, but more home building certainly won't hurt,"" said Matthew Speakman, economist at online real estate firm Zillow. ""For now, it appears that builders are game for the challenge."" ,The housing market is regaining momentum after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times last year, pushing down mortgage rates from last year's multi-year highs. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to an average of 3.65% from its peak of 4.94% in November 2018, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. ,Though a survey on Monday showed confidence among homebuilders dipped in January, it remained near levels last seen in mid-1999. Builders said they ""continue to grapple with a shortage of lots and labor while buyers are frustrated by a lack of inventory, particularly among starter homes.""  ,While the housing market accounts for about 3.1% of gross domestic product, it has a bigger footprint on the economy, which is now in its 11th year of expansion, through industries such as utilities, retail and manufacturing. ,In a separate report on Friday, the Fed said manufacturing production rose 0.2% last month, adding to November's 1.0% increase. Manufacturing output, however, fell 1.0% in the fourth quarter. It dropped 0.2% in 2019, the first decline since 2016. ,The U.S.-China trade war has eroded business confidence, leading to a decline in capital expenditures. The housing market improvement is offsetting some of the drag on the economy from weak manufacturing.     ,Residential investment rebounded in the third quarter after contracting for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the 2007-2009 recession. It is expected to contribute to gross domestic product again in the fourth quarter. ,Groundbreaking activity could, however, slow in the coming months as building fell 3.9% to a rate of 1.416 million units in December after hitting the highest level in more than 12-1/2 years in November. An estimated 1.369 million building permits were authorized in 2019. ,Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, jumped 11.2% to a rate of 1.055 units in December, the highest level since June 2007. Single-family housing starts rose in the Midwest and the populous South. They fell, however, in the Northeast and West. ,Single-family housing building permits slipped 0.5% to a rate of 916,000 units in December after rising for seven straight months.  ,Starts for the volatile multi-family housing segment vaulted 29.8% to a rate of 553,000 units last month. Starts for buildings with five units or more were the highest since July 1986. Permits for the construction of multi-family homes fell 9.6% to a rate of 500,000 units.

Officials at the planemaker said the issue relates to a software power-up monitoring function that verifies some system monitors are operating correctly. ,One of the monitors was not being initiated correctly, officials said.

The petition cites ""127 consumer complaints to NHTSA involving 123 unique vehicles.

Others claimed the sudden acceleration happened while in traffic or when using driver assistance systems and led to crashes. ,In one complaint, a driver said a 2015 Tesla Model S 85D in California was closed and locked when he claimed ""a few moments later the vehicle started accelerating forward towards the street and crashed into a parked car."" ,A Tesla driver in Avondale, Pennsylvania, was pulling into a parking spot at an elementary school when the vehicle accelerated on its own, the complaint said adding: ""It went over a curb and into a chain link fence."" ,Another complaint said a Tesla driver in Andover, Massachusetts was approaching her garage door ""when the car suddenly lurched forward: and ""went through the garage door destroying two garage doors."" The Tesla stopped when it hit the garage's concrete wall.  ,In October, the agency said it was reviewing whether Tesla should have recalled 2,000 of its electric cars in May instead of issuing a software upgrade to fix a potential defect that could have resulted in battery fires in Model S and Model X vehicles from the 2012-2019 model years. ,The 2,000 vehicles covered by the September petition to the NHTSA received a battery management software upgrade in May in response to a potential flaw that could trigger non-crash-related fires.

"VANCOUVER/TORONTO (Reuters) - Extraditing Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou to the United States based on American sanctions against Iran would set a dangerous precedent and could even undermine Canada's policy towards Iran, Meng's lawyers argued in court documents released on Friday. ,Meng, 47, was arrested at the Vancouver International Airport on Dec. 1, 2018, at the request of the United States, where she is charged with bank fraud and accused of misleading the bank HSBC (,) about Huawei Technologies' business in Iran. Meng has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition. ,Canada's attorney general said in submissions released last week that Meng was being extradited because she fraudulently mislead HSBC, and that U.S. sanctions should be taken into account as contributing to the legal environment in which the fraud took place - not as a reason for the extradition. ,Meng's team called the attorney general's argument ""circular,"" arguing that because prosecutors relied on U.S. sanctions to establish a risk of economic deprivation in both countries, ""American law becomes Canadian law. Double criminality becomes single criminality."" ,They wrote that allowing the attorney general to use U.S. sanctions as a reason to extradite set a dangerous precedent, because it would ""interfere with the (Canadian) government's prerogative in foreign affairs ... In a democratic society, important public policy choices are best made in the elected legislative assembly rather than by judicial actors."" ,Meng appeared in court on Friday for the first time in several months, for a case management conference to schedule hearings addressing the Canadian attorney general's claims of privilege on releasing some documents requested by Meng's legal team. ,Wearing dark slacks and sipping from a pink thermos, Meng appeared calm but serious, refraining from waving to journalists as she has while entering the courtroom on other occasions. ,The first phase of the extradition hearing will begin on Monday in a federal court in Vancouver.

He married a Japanese woman and they had two sons, who later feuded over control of the business empire in 2015.  ,Now, Shin Dong-bin, the younger son, is at the helm of the retail conglomerate. ,Due to its deep links to Japan, Lotte has sometimes faced a  public backlash in South Korea, leading to a boycott of its products when ties between the two countries worsened.     ,In 2017, Lotte also became the biggest corporate casualty of South Korea's diplomatic row with China over Seoul's decision to deploy a U.S. anti-missile system to counter North Korean threat.

"PARIS/MUNICH (Reuters) - European industrial policy chief Thierry Breton dismissed claims that relying on European companies to build a 5G network would delay its rollout, weighing in on an increasingly tense debate in Germany over the risk posed by China's Huawei. ,In a speech at the DLD conference in Munich on Sunday, Breton, a former French finance minister, warned policy-makers in Germany and elsewhere that the new 5G technology will require more stringent security rules than previous generations. ,""Setting up strict security conditions will not create delays in the roll out of 5G in Europe,"" Breton said, sticking to the line contained in prepared remarks obtained by Reuters in advance. ,""Europe, including Germany of course, is on track. We are not, and won't be, late in Europe on the deployment of 5G."" ,The warning by Breton contrasts with comments by German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer who said earlier this week that if Chinese companies were excluded, the construction of the 5G network would be postponed for at least five to ten years. ,German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives are divided over whether to support a proposal by their Social Democrat junior coalition partners that, if approved, would effectively shut out the Chinese technology giant from the network.  ,Merkel's right-left government, like all of Europe, is under pressure from the United States to bar Huawei, whose gear Washington says contains ""back doors"" that would enable China to spy on other countries.  ,Breton, who heads the vast 'Single Market' portfolio in the new European Commission which includes industrial policy, has said Europe should preserve its ""technological sovereignty"" by ensuring it has domestic alternatives in strategic areas. ,A so-called ""toolbox"" of security standards that EU member states should apply to their 5G networks would be ready this month, he added: ""Everybody is welcome in Europe, but more and more we will issue clear rules - and everybody will have to fulfill all these rules."" ,In his speech, he did not explicitly call for a ban on Huawei, saying: ""Any company, European or not, will be welcome provided of course that they abide by our European rules. We will not build a European fortress."" ,But the call to favor European providers such as Nokia (,) and Ericsson (,) and set up more stringent security rules will please opponents of the Chinese company. ,The new impetus by the EU executive echoes calls by French President Emmanuel Macron and others to prevent Europe from relying on China and the U.S. for strategic infrastructure that could be used as geopolitical leverage in the future. ,Germany's Seehofer, who is originally from Bavaria, whose car industry is reliant on exports to China, has said he was against banning Chinese telecommunications equipment suppliers such as Huawei from helping build Germany's 5G network. ,""I can't see how we can set up a 5G network in Germany in the short term without the participation of Huawei,"" Seehofer told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper.    ,German operators are all customers of Huawei, the leading telecoms equipment vendor with a global market share of 28%, and have said that banning it would add years of delays and billions of dollars in costs to launching 5G networks. ,But these warnings were dismissed by Breton: ""Let me say it loud and clear: contrary to what some would like to suggest, Europe is not lagging behind in 5G.

Chief Executive Larry Fink told the thousands of companies it holds stakes in that sustainable investing was the ""strongest foundation"" for client portfolios. ,Generation Investment Management, a fund co-founded by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore with $25 billion of assets invested according to environmental and sustainability criteria, says temperature scores are an important development.  ,""This is an incremental indicator dial to help the stakeholder community engage in the urgency of the transition,"" David Blood, co-founder and senior partner, told Reuters. ,Despite the growing enthusiasm for temperature scores, a dearth of standardized data, methodologies and disclosure makes it extremely hard to calculate a single meaningful number. ,Andrew Howard, head of sustainable research at British asset manager Schroders, said his company was actively looking at adopting temperature scores but warned any approach must be ""robust and logical"". ,""There are a bunch of challenges here that you've got to work,"" he said. ,Investors have already been struggling with a comparatively simpler metric: the amount of greenhouse gases a company produces. Increasingly firms are estimating their ""carbon intensity"" based on the ratio of emissions to revenue. ,A portfolio temperature score, though, requires more complex calculations, including how companies contribute to global emissions and their planned reductions over time. ,Those numbers are then crunched with assumptions about the relationship between emissions and temperatures. The calculation gets even more complicated when factoring in uncertainty about how the world might conceivably achieve net zero emissions by 2050 - the target scientists say is needed to cap global temperature rises at 1.5C. ,""The biggest question mark is what exactly that pathway is going to look like,"" said Mara Childress at the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), a global initiative launched by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney. ,The TCFD said it was considering its position on the possible utility of temperature scores. ,The challenge becomes harder when investors look beyond stocks and corporate bonds to real estate and infrastructure, where there is less transparency over emissions, or to sovereign debt, where investors have less scope to engage with borrowers. ,Nevertheless, advisory firms say that as data improves, the differences between companies poised to benefit from the transition to a low carbon world, and those that will suffer, will become clearer. ,""A warming potential metric really helps you to understand which constituents of a portfolio ... are really the climate culprits,"" said David Lunsford, co-founder of Carbon Delta, part of data analytics and index company MSCI. ,""You could be exposed to a lot of risk if you pick companies that are not aligned with a sustainable future."" ,Scientists have been sounding the alarm over global warming for decades but investors have only begun to pay real attention in the last few years.  ,The TCFD, which is backed by the G20, is encouraging companies and banks to reveal more about the climate risks they face, as a precursor to making disclosures mandatory. ,Regulators are issuing increasingly strident warnings over the dangers extreme weather poses to economies and the risk that oil and gas infrastructure could be left stranded by a rapid transition to clean energy. ,Scientists warn that rises of several degrees could push global food systems to collapse, create many millions of refugees and wipe out coastal cities.   ,Speaking at a U.N. summit in December, Carney said temperature scores - also known as ""warming potentials"" - were one of the most promising options for addressing the lack of clarity over climate risk and helping companies cut emissions. ,""Such a forward-looking measure can help asset owners and asset managers understand the transition pathways of their investments and develop strategies to align financial flows with the necessary transition to net zero,"" said Carney, who starts a new role as U.N. climate envoy next month. ,The temperature scores published to date show how far away the companies in most portfolios are from meeting the Paris goals. Most of the scores assigned by companies such as German insurer Allianz British rival Aviva and Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund, hover between 2.8C and 3.8C. ,AXA Chief Executive Thomas Buberl said its temperature score was now down to 3.1C. ,""The question is for us: How do we get down from 3.1 to lower?"" he said. ""We've been very clear - and again it'll be over time that we'll have to do it - that we want to take actions and go down.""

"LONDON (Reuters) - A majority of people around the world believe capitalism in its current form is doing more harm than good, a survey found ahead of this week's Davos meeting of business and political leaders. ,This year was the first time the ""Edelman Trust Barometer"", which for two decades has polled tens of thousands of people on their trust in core institutions, sought to understand how capitalism itself was viewed. ,The study's authors said that earlier surveys showing a rising sense of inequality prompted them to ask whether citizens were now starting to have more fundamental doubts about the capitalist-based democracies of the West. ,""The answer is yes,"" David Bersoff, lead researcher on the study produced by U.S. communications company Edelman. ,""People are questioning at that level whether what we have today, and the world we live in today, is optimized for their having a good future."" ,The poll contacted over 34,000 people in 28 countries, from Western liberal democracies like the United States and France to those based on a different model such as China and Russia, with 56% agreeing that ""capitalism as it exists today does more harm than good in the world"". ,The survey was launched in 2000 to explore the theories of political scientist Francis Fukuyama, who after the collapse of communism declared that liberal capitalist democracy had seen off rival ideologies and so represented ""the end of history"". ,That conclusion has since been challenged by critics who point to everything from the rising influence of China to the spread of autocratic leaders, trade protectionism and worsening inequality in the wake of the 2007/08 global financial crisis. ,On a national level, lack of trust in capitalism was highest in Thailand and India on 75% and 74% respectively, with France close behind on 69%. Majorities prevailed in other Asian, European, Gulf, African and Latin American states. ,Only in Australia, Canada, the United States, South Korea, Hong Kong and Japan did majorities disagree with the assertion that capitalism currently did more harm than good. ,The survey confirmed a by-now familiar set of concerns ranging from worries about the pace of technological progress and job insecurity, to distrust of the media and a sense that national governments were not up to the challenges of the day. ,Within the data there were divergences, with Asians more optimistic about their economic prospects than others across the world. There was also a growing split in attitudes according to status, with the affluent and college-educated much more likely to have faith in how things were being run. ,Of possible interest to corporate leaders gathering in Davos this week was the finding that trust in business outweighed that in governments and that 92% of employees said CEOs should speak out on the social and ethical issues of the day. ,""Business has leapt into the void left by populist and partisan government,"" said Edelman CEO Richard Edelman.

"LONDON (Reuters) - More than a thousand banks, asset managers, payments companies and insurers in the European Union plan to open offices in post-Brexit Britain so they can continue serving UK clients, regulatory consultancy Bovill said on Monday. ,The new offices and staff will help mitigate the loss of business going the other way as the current unfettered two-way direct access between Britain and the EU comes to an end in December following a Brexit transition period.  ,As a first step, the companies, who until now have been able to serve UK customers directly from their home base, have applied for temporary permission to operate in Britain after Jan. 31 when the UK leaves the bloc, Bovill said, using figures obtained from Britain's Financial Conduct Authority. ,""These figures clearly show that many firms see the UK as Europe's premier financial services hub,"" said Michael Johnson, a consultant at Bovill. ,More than 300 financial firms in Britain have opened EU hubs to continue serving clients in the bloc after Brexit, according to a recent survey from New Financial think tank. ,Consultants EY said on Monday that large UK-based firms had now implemented plans enabling them to continue operating in the EU after Brexit. It maintained its estimate that around 7,000 positions would be relocated from London to the continent and a further 2,400 jobs created and hired for locally at the new EU hubs. ,Firms are now carefully watching negotiations on Britain's future relationship with the EU, EY said. ,Britain's finance minister Sajid Javid told the Financial Times on Saturday that future EU access would be under the bloc's ""equivalence"" system, a patchy and basic form of access used by the United States, Singapore and Japan. ,""For many, equivalence would provide much-needed certainty, but it is a complex framework with over 40 provisions, which is not guaranteed long term, and means different things to different firms,"" said Omar Ali, EY's UK financial services leader. ,Bovill said 228 firms from Ireland had applied for temporary permission to keep serving UK clients until they obtain full authorization for a new UK hub. ,""In practical terms, these figures mean that European firms will be buying office space, hiring staff and engaging legal and professional advisers in the UK,"" Bovill said. ,Firms from France, Cyprus and Germany have applied for 170, 165 and 149 temporary permissions respectively, the consultancy said. ,EY said banks will now have to decide whether having multiple hubs in the euro zone and Britain after Brexit makes economic and strategic sense or if some should be closed.

"RISHON LEZION, Israel (Reuters) - The rapid growth of digital assets and computer-driven investment advice has become a key challenge for regulators in trying to keep up with technological advances while seeking to protect investors, a U.S. markets regulator said on Monday. ,Robert Jackson, a commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commision, said the agency was seeking to enact laws that facilitate the changes in technologies. ,One issue the SEC was grappling with was ""robo advisors"" - algorithms that help people make investment decisions. ,""I know what it looks like when a human being commits fraud,"" Jackson told an Israel Securities Authority conference. ""It's a lot harder to detect when an algorithm defrauds the investor. But investors deserve no less protection simply because money is being moved around by an algorithm."" ,Jackson, a Democratic commissioner who was a capital markets banker early in his career, said there were 4,000 lawyers at the SEC, but few programmers who can help explain how algorithms work and what risks they pose to investors.  ,""In 20 years we may need to be an agency of 2,000 lawyers and 2,000 programmers,"" he said. ,Another struggle is regulating assets such as cryptocurrencies, which are ""exciting but come with risks"", he said. The aim was that the asset class does not become associated with fraud and investors are properly protected. ,At the same time, the SEC is concerned that technology innovators increasingly are preferring private markets over public ones to raise large amounts of capital, largely because company founders have more freedom to run their companies with less accountability and transparency. ,This poses a problem since many ordinary investors may be closed to many new tech firms. ,""We might create a system of public companies that are not exciting. Instead that growth is reserved for a small section of society that can invest in private markets. That can be very unhealthy,"" Jackson said. ,He proposes to improve disclosure from private firms by investing through intermediaries, which would mean investors would pay more but have lower risk. ,Having strong regulation also translates into a lower cost of capital, he added. ,Jackson also said he was in favor of more aggressive disclosures from companies when cyber attacks occur and that the SEC should partner with companies in combating cyber attacks.

"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Everyone knows that the global corporate tax system needs to be overhauled, Apple (,) Chief Executive Tim Cook said on Monday, backing changes to global rules that are currently under consideration. ,The growth of internet giants such as Apple has pushed international tax rules to the limit, prompting the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to pursue global reforms over where multinational firms should be taxed. ,The reforms being examined center around the booking of profits by multinational firms in low-tax countries such as Ireland where they have bases - and where Cook was speaking on Monday - rather than where most of their customers are. ,""I think logically everybody knows it needs to be rehauled, I would certainly be the last person to say that the current system or the past system was the perfect system. I'm hopeful and optimistic that they (the OECD) will find something,"" Cook said. ,""It's very complex to know how to tax a multinational... We desperately want it to be fair,"" the Apple CEO added after receiving an inaugural award from the Irish state agency responsible for attracting foreign companies recognizing the contribution of multinationals in the country. ,Apple is one of Ireland's largest multinational employers with 6,000 workers and both it and the Irish government have gone to court to fight a European Union order that Apple must pay 13 billion euros ($14.41 billion) in back taxes to Dublin. ,The appeal to the EU's second-highest court began in September and could run for years. Cook said Apple's belief that ""law should not retrofitted"" was at the heart of the case and that the company had great faith in the justice system. ,Apple's commitment to Ireland, which became its first European operation in 1980, was ""unshakable"", Cook said. ,The Apple chief executive also said that more regulation was needed in the area of privacy and must go further than the 2018 European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) privacy laws that handed regulators there significantly more powers. ,""I think more regulation is needed in this area, it is probably strange for a business person to be talking about regulation but it has become apparent that companies will not self-police in this area,"" he said. ,""We were one of the first to endorse GDPR, we think it is overall extremely good, not only for Europe.

"WASHINGTON/DAVOS (Reuters) - Global growth appears to have bottomed out but there is no rebound in sight and risks ranging from trade tensions to climate shocks makes the outlook uncertain, a top International Monetary Fund official said on Monday. ,For 2020 and 2021, the IMF trimmed back its global growth forecasts, mostly due to a sharper-than-expected slowdown in India and other emerging markets, even as it said that a U.S.-China trade deal added to hopes the activity was bottoming out. ,With trade wars weighing on exports and investment, the global economy expanded by 2.9% last year, its slowest pace since the global financial crisis, despite near synchronized central bank easing that added half a percentage point to global growth. ,""We have not reached a turning point yet,"" IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said told a news conference on the eve of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the Swiss ski resort of Davos. ""The reality is that global growth remains sluggish.  ,""Just in the very first weeks of the new year we have witnessed increased geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and we have seen the dramatic impact that climate shocks could have. We saw them in Australia as well as parts of Africa."" ,The IMF now sees growth at 3.3% this year, below its October projections for 3.4% and also cut the 2021 forecast to 3.4% from 3.6%.  ,The reductions reflect the IMF's reassessment of economic prospects for a number of major emerging markets, notably India, where domestic demand has slowed more sharply than expected amid a contraction of credit and stress in the non-bank sector. ,The IMF also said it marked down growth forecasts for Chile due to social unrest and for Mexico, due to a continued weakness in investment. ,The Fund said that an easing of tensions between the United States and China, which had stunted GDP growth in 2019, had boosted market sentiment, amid ""tentative"" signs that trade and manufacturing were bottoming out. ,The Fund's cautious outlook assumes that there are no additional flare-ups in U.S.-China trade tensions but Georgieva warned that the root cause of the problem is not yet fixed. ,""The underlying causes of trade tensions and the fundamental issues of reform of the trade system are still with us."" ,The IMF upgraded China's 2020 growth forecast by 0.2 percentage point to 6.0% because the U.S. trade deal included a partial tariff reduction and canceled tariffs on Chinese consumer goods that had been scheduled for December. These tariffs had been built into the IMF's previous forecasts. ,But the Fund did not give a boost to its U.S. growth forecast for China's pledges to increase purchases of U.S. goods and services by $200 billion over two years. Instead, the IMF said 2020 U.S. growth would be 0.1 percentage point lower than forecast in October, at 2.0% because of the fading stimulus effects from 2017 tax cuts and the Federal Reserve's monetary easing. ,Eurozone growth also was marked down 0.1 percentage point from October, to 1.3% for 2020, largely due to a manufacturing contraction in Germany and decelerating domestic demand in Spain. ,India saw a sharp, 1.2 percentage point cut to its 2020 growth forecast to 5.8%, the IMF's biggest markdown for any emerging market, because of the domestic credit crunch. Monetary and fiscal stimulus is expected to lift India's growth rate back to 6.5% in 2021, although this is still 0.9 percentage point lower than forecast in October. ,Other emerging markets saw forecast downgrades, the IMF said, including Chile, which has been hit by social unrest. Mexico will grow just 1.0% in 2020, down from 1.3% forecast in October. ",Big Story 15,1/20/2020 13:32,No turning point in sight as IMF predicts sluggish global growth

"LONDON (Reuters) - The BBC's most powerful man will step down in six months to allow a new person to lead negotiations with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government over a financing model for the publicly funded broadcaster. ,Director General Tony Hall said he would leave in the summer after seven years at the helm of Britain's biggest news provider, its most powerful cultural institution and the voice of the country to millions around the world. ,His successor will have to fight for the future of the organization and its funding model, which some critics say is outdated in the era of subscription services such as Netflix. ,Johnson has questioned if the 98-year-old corporation should continue to be supported by an annual fee paid by all viewing households regardless of how much they use its services.  ,Hall, who was appointed director general in 2012, said one leader should oversee both a mid-point charter review in 2022 and a 2027 renewal. ,""It must be right that the BBC has one person to lead it through both stages,"" Hall, 68, said in an email to staff. ,""As our country enters its next chapter it needs a strong BBC, a BBC that can champion the nation's creativity at home and abroad, and help play its part in bringing the UK together.""     ,With everything from news broadcasts and shipping forecasts to sci-fi dramas such as ""Doctor Who"" and natural history documentaries pioneered by David Attenborough, the BBC has shaped British culture for almost a century and is seen as one of the country's key levers of soft power.   ,But in recent years, the Beeb, as it is known in Britain, has come under criticism for awarding extravagant salaries to its stars, paying some women less than men and for what some politicians say is a London-centric bias. ,It is funded by what is in effect a 154.50-pound ($198) annual ""license fee"" tax on all television-watching households. Its TV, radio and online content reaches 92% of the population. ,The director general, who joined the BBC as a news trainee in 1973 and led its news operations from 1996 to 2001, had to restore public faith in the broadcaster after a historic sex abuse scandal. ,He agreed to a new funding deal in 2015 but had to take on the funding of the license fee for over-75s - a big hit to its finances.  ,Since then, he has clashed with the government over funding and the BBC has faced accusations of political bias from the government, the opposition Labour Party and Scottish nationalists. ,Hall, who will next become the chairman of London's National Gallery, defended the BBC in his email to staff.

""I think that word MAX should go down in the history books as a bad name for an aircraft."" ,""The MAX brand is damaged and there is really no reason for it,"" he added.  ,Boeing is halting production of the 737 MAX this month following the grounding in March of its best-selling plane after two fatal crashes in five months killed 346 people. ,A U.S. official briefed on the matter on Friday said U.S. regulator the Federal Aviation Administration is now unlikely to approve the plane's return until March, and that it could take until April. ,Airlines are still trying to gauge passengers' reluctance to fly on the MAX, and how long this will last, Udvar-Hazy said. ""Will it be two months, will it be six months, will it be different in different parts of the world?""  ,""Will people in the U.S. after a few months forget about the accidents and think 'oh, it's just another 737', or are there going to be parts of the world where people are going to be more superstitious and it will take longer for them to erase that stigma?"" ,The chief executive of another major aircraft lessor, Firoz Tarapore of Dubai Aerospace Enterprises (DAE), told the same conference he was worried he had not seen Boeing ""addressing in a proactive way"" the issue of customer confidence in the aircraft.  ,DAE has shelved plans to order hundreds of single-aisle jets from Boeing or rival Airbus, citing high prices.  ,Dublin-based lessor Avolon, which has 148 MAX jets on order, was more sanguine, predicting that strong demand for the plane as a Boeing product would support valuation. ,""Boeing's 737 MAX will safely return to revenue service in 2020 (and) airlines and passengers will turn up to fly,"" it said in its 2020 Outlook publication.  ,Udvar-Hazy said he did not expect the MAX to flood the market and push down lease rates once it is cleared to fly, as Boeing is unlikely to be able to deliver more than 50-60 jets per month including new production.  ,Any fall in lease values due to concerns about the MAX were likely to be temporary, Udvar-Hazy said.

"PARIS (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (,) is the latest investment bank to significantly expand its Paris hub as part of plans to relocate some services from London after Britain's exit from the European Union, snapping up new premises in the French capital. ,JPMorgan would have said ""No"" to a Paris move back in 2016, its French executive told Reuters, but government-led labor law and taxation reforms made it review its stance. ,The U.S. bank said it plans to buy a building in central Paris from France's BNP Paribas to house up to 450 staff in coming years, allowing it to keep operating in the EU once the current unfettered two-way direct access between Britain and the bloc comes to an end in December following a Brexit transition period. ,The expansion is expected to make the French capital, where it currently has 260 staff, its second-largest base in Europe behind London, where there are 10,000 staff, JPMorgan said. ,It currently has 600 staff in Luxembourg and 450 in Frankfurt. ,The bank will initially transfer sales teams, followed by  trading staff depending on the timing of Britain's full withdrawal from the European Union, Kyril Courboin, JPMorgan's CEO of France, told Reuters. ,""Paris is going to be the second pole for our market activities in Europe,"" he said. ""London will still be number one because we are only transferring euro activities."" ,He declined to disclose the purchase price of the new building, which is close to JPMorgan's existing Paris offices on the prestigious Place Vendome. ,The move is part of a wider trend of banks shifting selected activities to euro-zone cities ahead of Brexit, without calling into question London's dominance as Europe's premier financial center. ,Large international banks and investors could relocate around 4,000 jobs to Paris, the French financial lobby Paris Europlace said, citing data from ""Choose Paris Region"", which helps international companies set up business in Paris. ,""In addition to the new announcements made by American banks...Asian investors, from HongKong and Singapore...confirm their wish to strengthen their activities in Europe, in particular in Paris,"" Arnaud de Bresson, chief executive of Paris Europlace, told Reuters. ,Wells Fargo, which currently has three job openings in Paris, said in October it had chosen the city as its European hub for post-Brexit trading activities.

"GENEVA (Reuters) - Global direct foreign investment (FDI) dipped slightly around the world last year, hit by massive divestment in Hong Kong and a drop in flows into Britain due to Brexit uncertainty, the United Nations said on Monday. ,FDI could rise marginally in 2020 on the back of modest growth as trade tensions between China and the United States ease, but geopolitical uncertainties and protectionist pressures are tempering expectations, it said. ,In 2019, global FDI flows were estimated at $1.39 trillion, down 1% from a revised $1.41 trillion in 2018, the U.N. trade and development agency UNCTAD said in a report. ,FDI, which includes cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&A), intra-company loans and investments, is a bellwether of globalization and a potential sign of future growth of corporate supply chains. ,Investment flowing into the Chinese territory of Hong Kong, the Asian financial hub that has been wracked by political unrest, nearly halved last year to $55 billion, the report said. ,""In Hong Kong there was $48 billion of divestment in terms of equity,"" James Zhan, UNCTAD's senior director of investment and enterprise, told Reuters. He noted that the former British colony was also affected by Sino-U.S. trade tensions. ,Competition from Shanghai and Shenzhen in mainland China as well as Singapore for high-end FDI, such as regional business hub functions and R&D activities of multinationals, also weighs on Hong Kong, he said. ,""Hong Kong's economy is a solid economy. Longer term-wise, it is attractive for international investment,"" Zhan said. , Britain, beset by uncertainty last year over the outcome of Brexit but now on course to leave the European Union on Jan. 31, saw inward FDI flows shrink by 6% to an estimated $61 billion last year, according to the report. ,FDI flows to developed economies fell by 6% last year to an estimated $643 billion, and remained at a historically low-level, at half of their peak in 2007, it said.  ,FDI to the EU as a whole fell by 15% to $305 billion, as several countries experienced ""strong volatility"", it said.  ,The EU and some member states have tightened their FDI entry screening, particularly over ""national security concerns"", Zhan said, and this could deter some FDI especially in technology. ,Flows to the United States, the largest FDI recipient worldwide, were stable at $251 billion. The report said the impact of a 2017 U.S. tax reform that reduced U.S. outward FDI flows appears to have ebbed. ,FDI flows to developing economies remained stable at an estimated $694 billion, led by China with a flat $140 billion.

"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Brazilian planemaker Embraer (,) is in the advanced stages of studying the launch of a new turboprop aircraft to be developed through a venture it is planning with Boeing, subject to necessary approvals, a top executive said on Monday. ,The aircraft would be in the same size range or even larger than the 70-seat ATR-72, a Franco-Italian aircraft that currently dominates the market, Embraer Commercial Aviation Chief Executive John Slattery told Reuters. ,""It sits in our target market, which we have always been clear is below 150 seats, and will have natural adjacency to the E2 offering,"" he said, referring to Embraer's family of 80-120-seat regional jets. ""The business case is going well."" ,Analysts say such a move could shake up a market dominated by ATR, which controls four-fifths of global sales in competition with the Q400 turboprop, sold by Bombardier last year to Longview Aviation of Canada and renamed the De Havilland Canada DHC-8.  ,China is also targeting the market with its Xian MA700. Analysts say turboprops are more efficient than jetliners over short distances, especially when oil prices are high.  ,Speaking as the aviation industry poured into Dublin for annual Airline Economics and Airfinance Journal conferences, Slattery said he believed a move by Embraer into turboprops would force a response from ATR and boost choice for airlines. ,He said ATR had a ""de facto monopoly"" because of recent marketing challenges facing its smaller Canadian rival.  ,ATR did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ,ATR claims to be the world's most profitable aircraft manufacturer with double-digit margins, though it does not publish financial data separately from its co-shareholders, Europe's Airbus (,) and Italy's Leonardo (,). ,It predicts demand for 2,390 deliveries of turboprop passenger aircraft with 61-80 seats over 20 year to 2037.     ,Embraer is also in ""meaningful"" discussions with engine makers General Electric (,), Rolls-Royce (,) and Pratt & Whitney Canada (,) about an engine for the new plane, Slattery said. Pratt is currently the sole turboprop supplier. ,Any launch decision would need to be backed by Boeing. ,Embraer is studying the plan as it tries to complete a 2018 agreement to fold its commercial aircraft activities into a venture to be controlled by Boeing (,).  ,The deal has won approval from several regulators but the European Union has launched a detailed competition review. ,Slattery said Embraer would not go ahead with the project on a standalone basis because of the cost - estimated at billions of dollars - and other priorities.  ,But he stressed there was no connection between the turboprop study and talks with regulators over the rest of Embraer's commercial airplane activities. ,""The amount of balance sheet required for a new state-of-the-art commercial aircraft is of an order of magnitude that we simply don't have the appetite for, outside of the joint-venture environment,"" Slattery said, adding, ""no JV, no TP"". ,He added he did not expect any such hurdle to arise because Embraer remains confident the Boeing deal will be approved on its merits, citing the support of several purchasing airlines. ,European Union regulators investigating the $4.2 billion tie-up have asked for more than 1.5 million pages of information and data on over 20 years of sales campaigns, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last month.

"(Reuters) - Wells Fargo & Co's (,) profit slumped 55% in the fourth quarter as new boss Charles Scharf set aside another $1.5 billion for legal costs related to the bank's sales scandal and promised ""fundamental changes."" ,The bank racked up operational losses of $1.9 billion in the final quarter of the year, partly for reserves to cover pending litigation related to its fake-account scandal that erupted more than three years ago. ,Wells Fargo, the fourth-largest U.S. lender by assets, has leaned on cost cuts to stabilize its bottom line while its revenue growth has been sluggish. However, a raft of fines and costs relating to sales abuses first uncovered in 2016 have been hard to control. ,Scharf said the bank's cost structure is simply too high, and pledged to improve performance once he gets through regulatory issues that need attention. ,""There is no reason why we shouldn't have best-in-class efficiency with these businesses at this scale, and that ultimately will be our goal,"" the new chief executive said on a call with analysts. ,He declined to give specific targets or a time frame for reaching them. ,Wells Fargo shares fell about 4% to $50.01. ,Cost-cutting was also a cornerstone of former CEO Tim Sloan's recovery plan, but the bank acknowledged last year that technology and compliance costs would remain high as it tried to satisfy regulators. ,Wells Fargo's non-interest expenses jumped 17% in the fourth quarter compared with the year-earlier period, due to the litigation costs, as well as higher compensation expenses. ,It spent 78.6 cents for every dollar of revenue it generated, up from 63.6 cents a year earlier, and far above Sloan's targeted range of 55-59 cents per dollar, or rival JPMorgan Chase & Co's (,) 55.9 cents. ,Investors watch that ratio closely to determine how well a company manages expenses. ,Wells is operating under heavy scrutiny as it tries to rebuild its reputation, including an unprecedented cap on its balance sheet by the Federal Reserve and frequent criticism from prominent U.S. politicians. ,Its problems began to unfold in September 2016, when the bank revealed that employees had opened potentially millions of bogus accounts in customers' names without their permission to hit sales targets set by management. Since then, Wells Fargo has found other problematic practices that cost customers money or otherwise harmed their financial well-being. ,Scharf is the fourth CEO in place since that time, and investors are hopeful he can finally get his arms around the problems. ,Although the bank has reached settlements with some regulators and private parties, there are still outstanding probes by U.S. authorities, including the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. It also operates under consent orders with regulators, as well as the Fed's asset cap. ,Scharf would not provide guidance on when Wells Fargo might resolve its regulatory issues. ,Wells Fargo's profit fell to $2.55 billion, or 60 cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from $5.71 billion, or $1.21 per share, a year earlier. ,Its adjusted earnings of 93 cents per share compared with analyst estimates of $1.12, on average, according to Refinitiv. Revenue of $19.86 billion came in below expectations of $20.12 billion. ,The bank's net interest income fell 11% as the Fed lowered interest rates three times last year to support the economy. ,However, its mortgage business benefited from lower rates, with income rising to $783 million from $467 million. ,Wells Fargo also continued to add deposits in the most recent quarter, with interest expense linked to deposits jumping 17%.

"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's unwrought copper imports rose 9.1% in December from the previous month to their highest since March 2016, customs data showed on Tuesday, as improving industrial activity and dwindling scrap metal supply lifted demand.         ,Imports of unwrought copper, including anode, refined and semi-finished copper products into China, the world's biggest copper consumer, stood at 527,000 tonnes last month, data from the General Administration of Customs showed.  ,That compared with 483,000 tonnes in November, itself a 13-month high, and was up 22.8% from December last year.    ,(GRAPHIC: China copper imports since 2010 - ,) ,The bumper December number was partly due to a favorable price arbitrage between Chinese and international copper prices, allowing traders to profit by shipping metal into China, said Helen Lau, an analyst with Argonaut Securities in Hong Kong. ,""But also because of a turnaround in demand that we spotted since the fourth quarter of last year.

"DUBAI/LONDON (Reuters) - Global banks who worked on Saudi Aramco's 2222.SE record initial public offering are pushing for an additional ""incentive fee"", three sources familiar with the matter said, as they try to boost relatively low earnings from the deal.  ,Aramco said on Sunday it had exercised a ""greenshoe option"" to sell an additional 450 million shares, raising the size of its IPO to $29.4 billion - comfortably the world's biggest listing to date. ,But the energy giant's earlier decision not to market the deal internationally means most banks involved in selling Aramco's shares will earn less than $5 million each, according to two of the sources, a low amount for such a large deal.  ,Now banks are in discussions with Aramco for the payment of the ""incentive fee"" under a clause in the contract that gives the Saudi government the discretion to pay banks an extra sum if the listing went well.  ,One source said they are arguing this will keep the banks committed if Aramco opts to sell more shares on an international exchange.   ,The payment of incentive fees - used to keep the base fees on a listing low and push banks to work harder - is increasingly common for IPOs in Europe and the U.S. but rare in the Gulf. The sources did not say how much extra the banks could be paid, although it would likely vary between institutions.     ,Aramco was not immediately available to comment. ,The oil giant picked nine banks as joint global coordinators in September: JPMorgan (,), Morgan Stanley (,), Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup (,), Credit Suisse (,), Goldman Sachs (,), HSBC (,), NCB Capital and Samba Financial Group 1090.SE. ,All the banks either declined to comment or did not immediately respond to a request for comment when contacted by Reuters.  ,The IPO was scaled back in size and scope before launch - with the targeted valuation revised down to $1.7 trillion from $2 trillion and the float cut to 1.7% of the company from the expected 2%.  ,Aramco also canceled marketing events in developed markets like the United States and Britain after lukewarm interest from foreign institutional investors who felt Aramco was not worth more than $1.5 trillion, sources said. ,The decision meant the coordinating banks could only work on reverse inquiry and could not market or solicit investors directly.  ,""All protocols were changed and three banks were in control of the process,"" said one of the sources, referring to NCB, Samba and HSBC. ,The oil giant paid just 25 basis points as a base fee on its deal size, earning banks just over $60 million. In contrast, the IPO of China's Alibaba (,) in New York, which was the previous largest listing, earned banks $300 million.  ,The bulk of the base fee from Aramco's IPO went to the three leading banks, said the sources, one of whom added that each got around $10 million.

"BANGALORE/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - In the months since office-sharing startup WeWork's botched public debut, mid- and late-stage investors in big start-ups have been pushing for more safeguards in case their firms fail to go public or sell shares at a lower valuation than pre-IPO financing rounds. ,Fundraising terms are rarely made public, but more than a dozen Silicon Valley-based lawyers, entrepreneurs and venture-capital investors told Reuters that since WeWork's canceled public offering and other ill-fated IPOs, investors have been securing protections of their original investments in ""unicorns"" - private companies valued at $1 billion or more. ,Tougher terms are the price to pay for ensuring late-stage funding and sustaining the pipeline of initial public offerings, but also can be detrimental for founders, employees and early-stage investors, which in turn could make M&A deals challenging.  ,A quarterly survey by law firm Fenwick & West, which tracks deal terms of startup clients, showed a sharp rise in those with senior liquidation preferences for later stage funding rounds in the third quarter, the time when WeWork's IPO plan unraveled. (,) ,For a graphic on Interactive graphic on liquidation preference clauses in deals, click , ,Safeguards include a higher minimum price on shares in an IPO, ""ratchets"" that give investors more shares if the shares are priced below what they paid, guarantees of a certain return on investments, and rights to block the IPO. ,""Because many of these unicorn valuations are super high relative to historical IPO values, growth investors are putting in more structure around IPOs,"" said Ivan Gaviria, a partner at Gunderson Dettmer, a Silicon Valley law firm that works with venture-backed companies and investors. ,WeWork's lofty $47 billion valuation tumbled to less than $8 billion after it scrapped its IPO in September amid a public shareholder-founder dispute that led to the founder-CEO's ousting and a bailout by SoftBank (,). ,The Japanese technology conglomerate, which has invested in several high-profile tech start-ups including Uber Technologies (,), has been among late-stage investors especially forceful in demanding more safeguards in the event of a failed IPO. ,Over the past four months, every SoftBank-led funding discussion for mid-to-late stage Internet startups has involved tougher terms for founders and employees, especially for commitments of $200 million to $300 million or more, according to a person familiar with the discussions. ,For instance, in December when SoftBank was in relatively advanced talks to invest in pharmaceutical delivery startup Alto Pharmacy, the investment partners from its Vision Fund sought price protection clauses, as well as stronger corporate governance processes at the company, that person said.  ,SoftBank and Alto Pharmacy, which was previously known as ScriptDash, declined to comment.  ,An investor with a liquidation preference would get paid first when the company folds or is sold.  ,To be sure, some experts note that the push for greater safeguards preceded the WeWork debacle, but most lawyers and investors Reuters has interviewed said it has intensified after the WeWork flame-out.  ,Some investors are even asking to get back even more money than they put in, said Ed Zimmerman, partner at law firm Lowenstein Sandler, who represents tech companies and investors. ,Sandy Miller, general partner at IVP, a later stage venture capital firm which is an investor in Uber, said many firms, including IVP, still prefer ""clean term sheets"" that put founders and all investors on equal footing.  ,However, an investor may want extra protection if founders push for higher valuations at a time when the market is leveling off.  ,""You may say, well, we can agree to a bit higher valuation, but we're going to need some terms around it.""  ,Shawn Carolan, partner at Menlo Ventures, said investors have also been pushing for more say on certain matters. ""It's mostly about compensation, indebtedness, major capital purchases or commitments, and major business agreements,"" said Carolan, who is the investment lead on Uber, among others. ,Yet financial safeguards in particular can make it harder to make deals, especially when the company is sold rather than goes public, because once late-stage investors get their guaranteed cut, there might be not much left for anyone else.  ,""How do you buy a company with $400 million or $800 million of liquidation preference for under a billion dollars?"" Zimmerman said. ""And who can do that?""  ",Business News,1/13/2020 11:15,WeWork debacle has unicorn investors seeking cover
"SEATTLE (Reuters) - Seattle, the Pacific Northwest city where home-grown online retailer Amazon.com has increasingly flexed its political muscle, is expected to approve on Monday legislation banning political contributions by companies with at least 5% foreign ownership. ,The move is likely to trigger renewed debate on the legality of corporate donations in U.S. elections while drawing an immediate court challenge. ,A six-member committee of Seattle City Council has already unanimously approved the measure, making it almost certain that the full nine-member council will pass it on Monday. ,The bill is widely viewed as aimed at reining in political spending from companies such as Amazon.com (,). Amazon, Seattle's largest employer, donated a record $1.5 million to back a slate of pro-business candidates in the November council elections - a campaign that was largely unsuccessful. ,At least 9% of Amazon's stock is owned by foreign investors, according to financial data provider Refinitiv.  ,A spokesman for Amazon, which has been butting heads with the city for two years over attempts to levy more taxes on the company, declined to comment. ,""What they are proposing is likely an unconstitutional backdoor ban on U.S. companies speaking about local elections,"" Jim Manley, an attorney with the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation, told Reuters. ,The U.S. Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United ruling struck down limits on political contributions by corporations or unions. Companies and unions may not give money directly to campaigns but may spend unlimited amounts on ads and other means. ,The legislation before the Seattle City Council says that companies that have at least 5% of their shares held by foreigners, or 1% by a single foreigner, are subject to foreign influence and therefore cannot participate in elections.  ,Amazon's $1.5 million political donation for Seattle's November elections represented more than half of the nearly $2.7 million raised by a Super Pac for those elections. Four years ago, Amazon donated $25,000. ,Super Pacs may accept unlimited contributions from any non-foreign source. ,Amazon began to prominently flex its political muscle in May 2018 when the Seattle council approved an employee ""head tax"" on the city's largest companies, in order to combat a housing crisis. Just four weeks later, the City Council repealed the tax after a coalition of businesses, with Amazon at the forefront, mounted a well-financed campaign for a referendum to repeal the tax. ,Socialist council member Kshama Sawant says she will restart the ""Tax Amazon"" campaign she led in 2018 with a rally at City Hall on Monday.    ,Seattle is not the first city to take aim at campaign spending.

"(Reuters) - Italy's biggest commercial broadcaster Mediaset (,) holds a shareholder meeting on Friday over governance changes needed to enable a pan-European expansion plan, which its second-largest investor Vivendi (,) is fighting in court. ,Following are key events in the prolonged dispute: ,April 2016 - Vivendi agrees to buy Mediaset's pay-TV business, billed as a major step in billionaire businessman Vincent Bollore's plan to build a southern European content and video-on-demand powerhouse. The two companies agree to take a 3.5% stake in each other. ,July 2016 - Vivendi backs away from the original deal, proposing an alternative that would give it a bigger direct stake in the broadcaster. ,Vivendi says the main reason is the unreliability of Mediaset Premium's financial forecasts for 2016 to 2018. ,The deal falls apart as Mediaset rejects Vivendi's new proposal and announces legal action against the French group. ,Dec. 2016 - Vivendi builds up a 28.8% stake in Mediaset in a move condemned by the Italian broadcaster. ,April 2017 - Italy's communications watchdog orders Vivendi, which is also the top shareholder in Telecom Italia (,), to cut its stake in either the telecoms group or Mediaset within a year to comply with rules designed to prevent a concentration of power. ,April 2018 - Vivendi transfers a 19.19 percent Mediaset shareholding to a trust to comply with the regulator's ruling. ,The legal battle continues on multiple fronts, including a 3 billion euro damages request by Mediaset over the failed pay-TV deal and repeated complaints by Vivendi about not being allowed to exercise its voting rights at Mediaset shareholder meetings. ,Sept. 2019 - Mediaset shareholders back a plan to create a pan-European media group under a new Dutch holding, fending off opposition from Vivendi. ,Under the plan, both Mediaset and its Spanish unit will be merged into a Dutch holding company MediaForEurope (MFE). ,Vivendi, which says the new structure tightens Fininvest's grip, challenges the plan in court in Spain and Italy. ,Oct. 2019 - A Spanish court suspends Mediaset's corporate overhaul, ruling in favor of Vivendi. Mediaset appeals. ,Nov. 2019 - Mediaset and Vivendi fail to hammer out a deal by a court-imposed deadline to end their legal stand-off. ,Dec. 2019 - A Milan court postpones a decision on Vivendi's request to suspend Mediaset's corporate overhaul until Jan. 21 at the earliest, leaving the reorganisation on hold.

"BEIJING/PARIS (Reuters) - Development of China's C919 single-aisle plane, already at least five years behind schedule, is going slower than expected, a dozen people familiar with the program told Reuters, as the state-owned Commercial Aircraft Corporation (COMAC) struggles with a range of technical issues that have severely restricted test flights.     ,Delays are common in complex aerospace programs, but the especially slow progress is a potential embarrassment for China, which has invested heavily in its first serious attempt to break the hold of Boeing and Airbus on the global jet market.      ,The most recent problem came down to a mathematical error, according to four people with knowledge of the matter.      ,COMAC engineers miscalculated the forces that would be placed on the plane's twin engines in flight - known in the industry as loads - and sent inaccurate data to the engine manufacturer, CFM International, four people familiar with the matter told Reuters. As a result, the engine and its housing may both have to be reinforced, the people said, most likely at COMAC's expense – though another source denied any modification. ,That and other technical and structural glitches meant that by early December, after more than two and a half years of flight testing, COMAC had completed less than a fifth of the 4,200 hours in the air that it needs for final approval by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), two people close to the project told Reuters.      ,COMAC, which has been developing the C919 largely in secret since 2008, rarely discloses its targets. Company official Yang Yang told Chinese state media in September that he expected certification by the country's regulators in two to three years, without giving any further details. The company's previous publicly stated target was end-2020. Other COMAC officials have said they are aiming for certification and delivery in 2021.     ,COMAC did not respond to Reuters requests for comment for this story. CFM, a joint venture between General Electric and France's Safran, declined comment.      ,COMAC has still not finalised the correct calculations and data to send to the engine manufacturer, which are key to ensuring that the engine does not fail under heavy loads, one of the sources told Reuters. Another said load calculations often evolve during development. ,But given the uncertainty, there is no guarantee COMAC will meet Yang's 2021-2022 target, people close to the program told Reuters.     ,""Things do not always work out as planned, but I hope COMAC would slow down a bit and try not to rush things,"" one of the sources familiar with the engine issue told Reuters. ""Otherwise there will be tons of issues later on.""           ,The engine miscalculation does not reflect a lack of theoretical understanding - China has been putting people in space for almost two decades. But it does illustrate the national aerospace manufacturer's lack of experience in designing and building commercial aircraft.     ,Problems have not been confined to the drawing board. COMAC found cracks in the horizontal stabilizers of some of the first few aircraft built, two sources said, although that problem has now been fixed. It also found a gearbox attached to the engine was vulnerable to cracking, which caused an engine to shut down during a test flight, three sources told Reuters, a problem that potentially affects all six C919 jets now in test flights.      ,Regular inspections of the gearbox to check for cracks and leaking oil have curtailed COMAC's flight test program, they said.      ,The gearbox problem, discovered in 2018 and not previously reported, was due to unexpected vibrations, two sources told Reuters. Engineers on the program have found ways to minimize the risks, the sources said.       ,Unwanted vibration, which in the worst case can shred parts inside an engine, is a problem faced by even long-established aerospace manufacturers. U.S. engine maker Pratt & Whitney revised software due to destructive vibration on some new engines, Reuters reported in October.     ,However, the accumulation of problems has put COMAC significantly behind schedule, which could prove costly.     ,The C919 is designed to compete with the Boeing 737 MAX and Airbus 320neo families. After Boeing and Airbus struck deals to take over production of rival planes made by Embraer and Bombardier, China's COMAC is now effectively the third option in the market for planes with more than 100 seats.      ,Most industry forecasters now expect the prolonged cyclical boom in demand for commercial planes to fade this year, as business confidence wanes amid geopolitical tensions, meaning a plane that debuts in 2021 or 2022 will likely miss out on orders for years to come.      ,COMAC is aware of the time pressure. The last three of its six test flight C919s were put into the air for their first flight before the paint job had been completed, sources told Reuters.          ,Beijing made the C919 an integral part of its 'Made in China 2025' initiative, designed to catch up on sophisticated technologies and help the country become self-sufficient.      ,The effort has attracted the attention of U.S. federal prosecutors, who in 2018 charged a group of Chinese intelligence officers, hackers and company insiders with breaking into the networks of 13 aerospace manufacturers around the world, including a company whose description matches CFM, in order to steal sensitive data that might help China build a jet engine. China has denied any involvement in hacking.       ,Beijing may not be entirely disappointed if the C919 jet fails to compete immediately in international markets, some analysts say, as the Chinese government can direct its own airlines to buy the jet.      ,Chinese state-owned carriers and leasing companies account for the vast majority of the 815 provisional orders COMAC says it has received for the C919. The only overseas buyer so far is the leasing company GECAS, owned by General Electric. Few of the orders have been finalized.      ,""The C919's real mission is to conquer a domestic market dominated by its two foreign competitors,"" said Jean-François Dufour, chief analyst of DCA Chine-Analyse. ""Ten to 15 years from now, a next-generation C919, or other models developed by COMAC, may become real competitors on the global scene.""

"MADISON, Wis. (Reuters) - The global trade wars may not be over, but U.S. Federal Reserve officials on Thursday said the economy may have weathered the worst of it as risks begin to ease and businesses adjust to a new trade environment.  ,In separate speeches and interviews, Fed policymakers, including Vice Chair Richard Clarida, were uniform in saying that developments like expected ratification of the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement and next week's intended signing of an initial U.S.-China trade deal have made them more confident about the economy in the year ahead. ,""There are some indications that headwinds to global growth may be beginning to abate,"" Clarida said in remarks at a forum in New York. The Fed's three ""well-timed"" rate cuts last year have been ""providing support to the economy and helping to keep the U.S. outlook on track,"" he said. ,His comments, echoed by four Federal Reserve regional bank presidents, come just days before Chinese officials are expected in Washington to sign a ""Phase 1"" trade deal.    ,It will not mean a full resolution of the uncertainty that many economists feel has slowed growth and pushed down business investment, St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said at an economic outlook lunch with the Wisconsin Bankers Association. ,But Bullard said he feels companies are learning to adapt by shifting supply chains and strategies. The outlook now, he said, is for a ""soft landing"" from the recession risks that spiked last year around the trade war, with growth slowing, though not dramatically. ,Recent data has been mixed. New jobs numbers due on Friday will update a strong hiring report from December. An index of manufacturing, however, last week registered its worst performance in a decade, and recent job claims data pointed to a possible rise in unemployment. Inflation remains weak, and a risk to the Fed's outlook. ,Still, the turbulence of 2019 may be avoided, Bullard said. ,""Companies are not sitting there and sitting on their hands,"" as tariffs take effect and trade rules are rewritten, Bullard said. ""They have to think of ways to cope and it is going to mitigate the trade shock to the U.S. economy."" ,The Fed cut rates three times last year largely to protect against a sharper downturn as U.S. and Chinese officials ratcheted up tariffs on each other's goods and President Donald Trump threatened levies on other countries.   ,U.S. central bankers now say they are unlikely to move again absent a major shift in the economic outlook, for better or worse. Chicago Fed President Charles Evans said on Thursday that could mean no changes at all in 2020 to the Fed's policy rate, currently in a range between 1.5% and 1.75%. ,""If anything, my growth outlook has firmed a bit in the last ,several weeks,"" Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan told Reuters in an interview.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New applications for U.S. jobless benefits fell more than expected last week, but the labor market appears to be cooling, with the number of Americans on unemployment rolls surging to more than a 1-1/2-year high at the end of 2019. ,Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 214,000 for the week ended Jan. 4, the Labor Department said on Thursday. The fourth straight weekly decline saw claims almost unwinding the jump in early December, which was blamed on a later-than-normal Thanksgiving Day. ,""Jobless claims have returned to normal levels, showing the labor market is in a good place,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ,Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would fall to 220,000 in the latest week. The claims data was volatile in late 2019, with applications dropping to 203,000 at the end of November and shooting up to 252,000 in early December.  ,The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 9,500 to 224,000 last week. ,U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data as politics dominated sentiment. Stocks on Wall Street rose, with the main indexes hitting record highs after the United States and Iran moved away from an all-out conflict. ,The dollar .DXY gained versus a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell.     But the labor market could be losing momentum. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid vaulted by 75,000 to 1.80 million for the week ended Dec. 28, the highest level since April 2018. The weekly increase was the largest since November 2015.  ,The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims rose 33,000 to 1.74 million. Some of the surge in continuing claims could be related to year-end volatility.  ,""The continuing claims data also may exhibit some volatility around the holiday season, but the trend in the data appears to have weakened over the past month or so,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.  ,Labor market strength is helping to keep the economy on a moderate growth pace despite a deepening downturn in manufacturing. The White House's 18-month trade war with China has sapped business confidence and undercut capital expenditure. ,Though Washington and Beijing in December hammered out a ""Phase 1"" trade deal, considerable confusion remains about the details of the agreement, which is expected to be signed next week.  ,The U.S. government is expected to report on Friday that nonfarm payrolls increased by 164,000 jobs in December. While that would be a step down from November's robust gain of 266,000, the anticipated pace would still be well above the roughly 100,000 jobs per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population. ,The unemployment rate is forecast to be unchanged near a 50-year low of 3.5%. The Federal Reserve last month signaled interest rates could remain unchanged at least through this year. The Fed lowered borrowing costs three times in 2019.  ,Minutes of the U.S. central bank's Dec. 10-11 policy meeting published last week showed officials ""generally expected sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions,"" though some viewed next month's expected downgrade to employment growth as an indication the labor market was cooling. ,The government last August estimated the economy created 501,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months through March 2019 than previously reported, the biggest downward revision in the level of employment in a decade. That suggests job growth over that period averaged around 170,000 per month instead of 210,000. The revised payrolls data will be published on Feb. 7. ,""It is not clear what the data since then will look like, but we suspect more recent job growth could be revised down,"" said Kevin Cummins, senior U.S. economist at NatWest Markets in Stamford, Connecticut.

"HONG KONG/BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S.-listed online travel giant Ctrip is talking to banks about a planned secondary listing in Hong Kong, putting the group at the head of a queue of Chinese companies expected to follow Alibaba in establishing an investor base closer to China. ,Ctrip, also known as Trip.com Group Ltd, has approached China International Capital Corp, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley for its planned share sale in Hong Kong, said four people with knowledge of the matter. ,Ctrip, which had declined to comment earlier, late on Friday said: ""The specific details of the listing reported are not true.

More important is the underlying detail, the underlying detail really continue to drive home that the labor backdrop is tight. You saw an upward revision to wages in the prior month, which offsets some of the miss in the current month. The unemployment rate actually remains incredibly low, and out to the third decimal actually showed improvement. Even the underemployment rate improved. I think when you strip away some of the 'headline stuff' the guts of the report were really quite constructive if you were building the case for a consumer that's going to continue to chug along. And this report is very consistent with this idea."" ,""The bottom line: it came in a little under consensus but still, there are more jobs than required to hold the unemployment rate constant over the long term."" ,""Average hourly earnings continue to grow and the work week is stable. It kind of lines up with most of the commentary written by the Fed and others that the economy is perking along at something like trend growth, or a little above trend growth, so there aren't any real dangers here.""  ,""All of this suggests that the economy is ok and it's very consistent with our forecast of somewhere between 2% and 2.25% growth.""  ,""Not gangbusters, but not worrisome.

This doesn't suggest inflation is creeping higher. The low wage element does nothing to add to a fear about wages moving too high to quickly.

One thing I did see though to keep an eye on for the next couple of reports is the decline in manufacturing and transportation. One of the reasons I liked the last couple of jobs reports was because the transportation jobs increased so much so to see that decline gives me a note of caution. The retail numbers may not be as great as they initially appear only because if you look at building materials, garden supplies, etc one of the places we added jobs, they both lost jobs the month before, so I am just wondering if there is a timing factor there. From that point of view, I hate that retail and hospitality out of the first two areas normally, but given it is December, most of the retail jobs get added in October and November, again could be a little bit of a timing issue. In January I would like to see more business to business services back up there and healthcare leading the way.""  ,""This was as a milquetoast a report as (the Fed) could get, to be honest, so there is no reason to change any thought process on this one."" ,SAMEER SAMANA, SENIOR GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE, ST.

"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The idea of imposing a wealth tax on the richest Americans has elicited sharply divergent views across a spectrum of politicians, with President Donald Trump branding it socialist and progressive Democratic presidential contenders Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders prominently endorsing it. ,But it may have broad public support, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll that found nearly two-thirds of respondents agree that the very rich should pay more. ,Among the 4,441 respondents to the poll, 64% strongly or somewhat agreed that ""the very rich should contribute an extra share of their total wealth each year to support public programs"" - the essence of a wealth tax. Results were similar across gender, race and household income. While support among Democrats was stronger, at 77%, a majority of Republicans, 53%,  also agreed with the idea. ,A wealth tax is levied on an individual's net worth, such as stocks, bonds and real estate, as well as cash holdings, similar in concept to property taxes. It is separate from an income tax, which applies to wages, interest and dividends, among other sources. ,Asked in the poll if ""the very rich should be allowed to keep the money they have, even if that means increasing inequality,"" 54% of respondents disagreed. ,""Rich people have a right to blow their money on Lamborghinis and world-wide cruises or whatever,"" said Esin Zimmerman, 53, a lifelong Republican from Madison, Minnesota, who wants higher taxes for the wealthy. ""But that money could be used in other ways that help people."" ,Zimmerman said she would especially be in favor of a wealth tax that would help pay for government programs for U.S. military veterans, or help single parents with young children. ""It could put the border wall up,"" she said.  ,The results may reflect how the economic changes of the past roughly 20 years, from globalization to the financial crisis, have shaped attitudes about economic policy. ,According to polling by Gallup, concerns about the rich paying too little actually declined through the 1990s and early 2000s, a relative boom period for the United States. But the concerns have been climbing since the crisis years of 2007 to 2009, from 55% to more than 60% as of 2016 , ,The Reuters/Ipsos results suggested even stronger support for an annual levy on total wealth, not just income.  Warren and Sanders have touted the idea as a way to help pay for major social programs like Medicare for All and to reverse a stark rise in the share of wealth owned by the very richest Americans, known as the ""1 percent."" ,The poll also points to changing attitudes toward basic ideas such as ""keeping what you earn."" ,That notion, central to a winner-take-all brand of capitalism, got mixed reviews. While 56% of Republicans agreed the very rich should keep what they have regardless of the impact on inequality, 35% of Republicans disagreed with the statement, as did 71% of Democrats. ,Republican survey respondents interviewed by Reuters said they did not see their support for a wealth tax conflicting with their party ideals or their support for Trump.  ,Kathy Herron, 56, a Republican who lives in Santa Rosa, California, said her support for Trump - a self-proclaimed billionaire - stems from his hardline policies on illegal immigration. In her view, the president would do well to support higher taxes on rich Americans. ""We're taxed from one end to the other, and it just seems the rich don't pay their share,"" she said. ,In recent years in particular, mainstream economic institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the Federal Reserve have taken seriously the possibility that high levels of wealth and income inequality may be not just politically corrosive, but bad for economic growth.  ,At the most recent Fed policy meeting, staff members presented research on how families' differing access to credit might make a recession worse — the sort of exercise that shows how unequal starting points among households can influence national outcomes. ,Economic and market trends have likely reinforced doubts about who gets ahead, and how fast. Since the start in 2009 of a now-decade-long recovery, the top 1 percent's share of national net worth has grown from 27.8% to 32.2%, driven by a record-setting boom in the stock market, according to Fed data.  ,Trump has cited the rise in equity markets as a selling point in his campaign, which is centered on taking credit for historically low unemployment, and a tariff-heavy trade policy that he says will restore manufacturing jobs. ,But that has not changed the country's wealth picture. While the share of wealth held by the bottom 50% of Americans has increased since the crisis, to 1.5% percent, longterm the trend is down, with their share at less than half what it was in 1989. The shares of wealth held by the middle and upper middle classes - or all other Americans save for the richest 1 percent — have all fallen since the crisis.

"MILAN (Reuters) - Italy's Mediaset on Friday won shareholder approval for governance tweaks needed to smooth a pan-European expansion plan despite opposition from its second-biggest investor Vivendi, which is fighting the project in court.  ,Controlled by the family of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, Mediaset (,) last year approved a plan to merge its businesses in Italy and Spain (,) under a Dutch-based company, called MediaForEurope (MFE). The broadcaster wants to use the new entity to pursue tie-ups in Europe to take on competition from streaming apps such as Netflix (,) and web giants like Google (,).    But Vivendi, led by billionaire Vincent Bollore, opposes the plan, saying the governance structure of the new entity would strengthen Berlusconi's grip on the company. ,Vivendi and Mediaset have been at odds since the French conglomerate dropped a deal to buy Mediaset's pay-TV unit in 2016 and then built up a 29% stake in the group, which the Italian broadcaster considers hostile. ,Two-thirds of that stake is held in a trust following a ruling by the Italian telecoms watchdog over Vivendi's excessive presence in the country's media and telecoms sectors, given its 24% holding in Telecom Italia (,).  ,The trust was prevented from voting at Friday's meeting.  ,Following Vivendi's legal challenge, a Spanish court has provisionally put the merger on hold, while a decision by a Milan court over the French group's request to suspend the deal is still pending.  ,In an effort to unblock the plan, Mediaset on Friday asked shareholders to approve changes to the bylaws of MFE suggested by the Milan court, easily winning the vote thanks to the Berlusconi family holding company Fininvest's 45.8% voting rights. ,Vivendi complained the trust's exclusion made the approval irregular. ,""The new plan ... has merely removed some blatantly abusive clauses, without modifying the disproportionate rights granted to Fininvest,"" it said. ,Doubts over the future of Mediaset's pan-European plan increased after Mediaset and Vivendi failed to resolve their multiple legal disputes, including the one over MFE, with an out-of-the court agreement. ,Mediaset faces a March deadline to see its Dutch holding company plan through, otherwise the decisions of a September shareholder meeting that approved the project will no longer be valid based on existing Dutch laws. ,""If the courts rule in our favour, we can do it,"" Mediaset Chief Executive Pier Silvio Berlusconi said when asked if the company was confident of completing the plan in time. ,The deadlock with Vivendi is weighing on Mediaset shares, which fell 5.5% in 2019 against a 27% rise in Italy's all-share index ,.  ,           (Graphic: Mediaset shares performance in 2019 compared to Italy's mid -cap index click, ,)           ",Business News,1/10/2020 7:05,Mediaset approves changes to keep pan-European TV plan afloat

Prosus controls iFood. ,The fight to buy Just Eat began in August when Takeaway struck a management-backed deal that would give Takeaway a 48% stake in the combined company. ,That plan was upended when Prosus laid down the first of three unsolicited rival bids in October. All were rejected as inadequate by Just Eat managers.  ,Prosus argued that Takeaway was underestimating the investment needed to fend off rivals such as Uber Eats and Amazon.com. ,Takeaway's Groen responded that food delivery was a low-margin business and his focus was on becoming the dominant ordering platform. ,The fight reached a dramatic climax on Dec. 19, when Prosus made its final offer and Takeaway responded minutes later with a higher bid, cutting the share of the merged company that will go to its own shareholders to 42.5%. ,Takeaway will have to prove that the business model it has pursued in Germany and the Netherlands, which has led to rapid sales growth and improved core earnings (EBITDA), will eventually lead to lasting profitability for the group.

"BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar, which has dominated currency market trading for the last two years, looks set to do so again in 2020, according to the latest Reuters poll of foreign exchange strategists. ,While most of those who forecast spot FX rates are still clinging to a view that the euro may edge up slightly by the end of the year, when asked about the overall trend, few say the well-established dollar dominance is about to quickly fade. ,Part of that stems from the recent flare-up in tensions between the United States and Iran, with investors piling into safe-haven assets such as the yen, which hit a three-month high on Wednesday. That has parallels with market behaviour during bouts of worry about the U.S.-China trade war last year.  ,Despite repeated calls for a weaker dollar from analysts throughout last year, the greenback ended 2019 without losing any ground against most currencies. It is now expected to go on a winning streak for at least six months. ,About 60% of analysts in the Jan 6-9 Reuters poll who answered an additional question - 32 of 57 - said the dollar will continue to dominate the market either from six to 12 months or for more than a year. ,Graphic: Reuters Poll - U.S. dollar dominance, , ,This time last year, over 60% of forecasters said the dollar's rally had already stalled. ,""Your forecast is one thing and your conviction levels another, and I think you can hear my conviction levels are pretty weak,"" said John Hardy, head of FX strategy at Saxo Bank, citing the plunge in currency volatility late last year that left currency markets mostly rudderless. ,""We all have to be a bit humble and see how this year shapes up."" ,However, with U.S. economic growth forecast to moderate this year and at the same time growth in other major economies expected to bottom out, the dollar could lose some of its shine. ,""We're not telling investors to go out and buy euros. What we're telling investors is that the U.S. is converging back to Europe, there are tentative signs across the data set that Europe is stabilizing,"" said Jamie Fahy, global macro and asset allocation strategist at Citi. ,""Broadly speaking, we're looking at the big picture theme of U.S. exceptionalism probably reversing."" ,In a sign of dollar fatigue setting in, speculators have cut back their bets in favour of the greenback to the lowest in two months, according to the latest data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. ,But there is no clear consensus on which currency or currencies could take the dollar head-on. ,Indeed, when analysts were asked which currencies were better poised to outperform the U.S. dollar this year, there was a near split among the poll respondents. ,Twenty-seven of 62 chose emerging market currencies, while 22 opted for developed ones. The 13 others said no currency was likely to knock the dollar off its perch. ,The euro, which has the potential to dent the dollar's strength, has fallen on hard times, losing nearly 7% over the past couple of years. ,However, analysts still expect the common currency to gain about 2% to trade around $1.13 in six months and then end the year nearly 4% higher at $1.15. It was last changing hands around $1.11 on Thursday. ,But much will depend on how euro zone economies perform. ,""If the U.S. has to cut rates because it's under severe downward pressure in terms of growth and global growth is weak  then it is harder to argue that the euro is going to see any material rebound,"" said Tim Riddell, macro strategist at Westpac. ,Over two-thirds of analysts who answered a separate question said central bank policies and economic performance were likely to hold more sway on currency markets this year. The remaining ones chose safe-haven buying and/or political tensions. ,That comes despite political tensions in recent years shoring up demand for safe-haven bets like dollar- and yen-denominated assets. ,Broadly, the more liquid and volatile Japanese yen was forecast to strengthen around 3% by end-2020. The other popular safe-haven bet, the Swiss franc, was expected to rise by a touch less than 1% against the dollar in a year. ,""Hopes for some reprieve from trade tensions reduced demand for safe haven assets into the final months of last year,"" said Jane Foley, head of FX strategy at Rabobank. ,""Not only is this set to reverse in 2020 if China-U.S. relations sour again, but Iranian-U.S. tensions have already lifted demand for the yen on the spot market.""

"LAUSANNE, Switzerland (Reuters) - The International Olympic Committee has to connect with hundreds of millions of gamers worldwide if the Olympic body is to remain relevant with the younger generation, IOC President Thomas Bach said on Friday. ,Bach also said games simulating sports could at some point in the future become a part of the Olympic programme. ,""Whether they could one day be considered for the Olympic programme the answer is yes,"" he told a news conference. ""It depends when this day is coming.""  ,The IOC has been working on developing connections with both the industry and gamers but it has also rejected many of the electronic games as too violent and not in line with the IOC's Olympic values. ,It is desperate, however, to tap into this young market, with its traditional Olympic TV viewership ageing fast. ,Bach earlier urged his members during the IOC session to look beyond the differences and find common ground that would allow federations to develop their own games suitable for a young Olympic audience and also develop regulations. ,""We have to acknowledge that we are not an isolated part of society,"" Bach said. ""We are living in the middle of society and want to keep our relevance and keep promoting our Olympic values. ,""We cannot ignore our involvement and we have to keep connected. We have to explore our opportunities."" ,Bach's comments came after a presentation by international cycling federation (UCI) president David Lappartient, who heads the esports and gaming liaison group set up by the IOC. ,Lappartient said there were some 2.2 billion active gamers worldwide, with around 150 million involved in esports. He said 75% of 12-17 year-olds play some form of electronic games. ,The UCI has already announced an esports cycling world championships for 2020 and Bach said that was a good example of how physical activity and electronic games could come together. ,""We have defined very clearly what divides us from this industry and in particular with regard to the values,"" Bach said. ""We have said there is a red line with regard to the content of some of these games. ,""We do not want to have anything to do with killer games or games promoting discrimination. We compete for the leisure time of the young generation. If we move on the platforms this young generation is moving we can also use this platform to promote our values."" ,Some IOC members, however, urged caution, saying more understanding of the industry was necessary before taking steps to join up with it. ,""We are a 19th century organisation trying to deal with a 21st century phenomenon,"" said the longest serving IOC member, 77-year-old Dick Pound of Canada, who has been in the IOC since 1978. ,""We can get taken to the cleaners in a major hurry if we are not careful with this.""

"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Soaring demand for SUVs drove record sales for premium carmakers including BMW and Mercedes last year, leaving the industry on collision course with government efforts to tackle global warming despite big investments in electric vehicles.  ,BMW (,) said on Friday deliveries by its main luxury brand rose 2% to a record 2,168,516 vehicles last year, thanks to a 21% jump in sales of its ""X"" branded sport-utility vehicles (SUV) which now make up 44% of the BMW brand's global sales. ,At Mercedes-Benz, the world's best selling premium car brand, every third luxury car sold last year was an SUV. ,Automakers across the world are investing billions in electric vehicles to try to meet tougher emissions regulations. But the jury is out on how many drivers will buy them.  ,""Consumer preferences for SUVs could offset the benefits from electric cars,"" the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned in its November World Energy Outlook 2019 report.  ,The IEA said a doubling in market share had seen emissions from SUVs grow by nearly 0.55 gigatons of carbon dioxide (CO2) during the last decade to roughly 0.7 gigatons.  ,As a result, SUVs were the second-largest contributor to the increase in global CO2 emissions since 2010 after the power sector - ahead of heavy industry including iron and steel, cement, aluminium, as well as trucks and aviation, it said. ,There are now more than 200 million SUVs around the world, up from about 35 million in 2010, accounting for 60% of the increase in the global car fleet since 2010, IEA data shows.  ,""If the popularity of SUVs continues to rise in line with recent trends, this could add another 2 million barrels per day to our projection for 2040 oil demand,"" it said. ,The German carmakers say their vehicles are among the most fuel efficient available, thanks to hybrid and other technologies, adding customers could also choose to buy smaller,  more frugal cars instead of SUVs.  ,Both BMW and Mercedes-owner Daimler (,) say they aim to achieve new sales records this year, and are preparing to launch fully electric SUVs - the BMW iX3 and Mercedes-Benz EQC - which they say shows a commitment to a cleaner future.  ,While acknowledging the growing popularity of SUVs, Germany's powerful VDA auto industry association said much of the demand was for more efficient models.  ,""Only just under 5% of SUVs are large luxury class vehicles. The market success of the SUV segment is mainly due to the model offensive in compact and medium-sized SUVs, with correspondingly lower fuel consumption,"" VDA said on Thursday.  ,The newly registered SUVs of German group brands had reduced their CO2 emissions by 35% since 2008, it added.  ,European Union lawmakers agreed in December 2018 that automakers had to cut CO2 emissions from cars by 37.5% by 2030 from 2021 levels, in addition to a 40% cut between 2007 and 2021, or face fines. ,Evercore ISI analysts say the average German auto fleet emission is still too high at around 124 grams per kilometre in Europe, compared with the average limit of 95 grams per kilometre for 2020. ,""The current CO2 performance is simply not good enough and we continue to flag that carmakers run the risk of facing considerable fines if more is not done,"" they said in a note. ,Electric and hybrid vehicles made up only 3.9% of new European sales in the third quarter of 2019. ,BMW plans to launch 25 hybrid and electric cars by 2023, with more than 12 models being fully electric versions.  ,By 2025, half of all its cars are expected to be hybrid or electric vehicles, it said.  ,Mercedes expects half of its sales to be hybrid or electric by 2030, with Europe reaching the 50% mark in 2025. ,Peter Fuss, a partner at EY, said German carmakers pushed sales of higher-margin SUVs last year ahead of the introduction of the more stringent European clean air rules in 2020. ,In the fourth quarter of 2019 there was an unusually large  rise in commercial registrations in Germany, Italy and Britain compared with figures for private consumers, in a sign carmakers were pushing more polluting models into the market. ,""We will not see the same growth rates in this segment as we did last year,"" Fuss said. ,Electric car registrations are expected to take off in mid 2020, he added.  ,But that will depend on drivers being prepared to buy them, and perhaps also on how cheaply manufacturers are prepared to sell them.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. job growth slowed in December after surging in the prior month, but the pace of hiring is enough to keep the longest economic expansion in history on track despite a deepening downturn in a manufacturing sector stung by trade disputes. ,The Labor Department's closely watched monthly employment report on Friday also showed the jobless rate holding near a 50-year low of 3.5%. A broader measure of unemployment dropped to a record low last month, but wage gains ebbed. The mixed report will probably not change the Federal Reserve's assessment that both the economy and monetary policy are in a ""good place.""  ,""The report suggests a moderate pace of economic growth,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. ""The Fed is comfortably on hold.""  ,Nonfarm payrolls increased by 145,000 jobs last month, with manufacturing shedding jobs after being boosted in November by the return to work of about 46,000 production workers at General Motors (,) after a strike, the government's survey of establishments showed. That was the smallest gain since May. ,But milder-than-normal temperatures in December boosted hiring at construction sites, and employment at retailers surged last month. Some of the slowdown in overall job growth in December is likely due to seasonal volatility associated with a later-than-normal Thanksgiving Day. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 164,000 jobs in December.  ,""Today's data also falls in line with a series of job growth decelerations that we've traditionally seen in years with calendar set-ups that involve a late Thanksgiving Day holiday, which often can lead to flattering November payroll data at the expense of December,"" said Rick Rieder, global fixed income chief at BlackRock in New York. ,Roughly 100,000 jobs per month are needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The economy added 14,000 fewer jobs in October and November than previously reported.  ,The final employment report of the decade showed the economy created 2.1 million jobs in 2019, the least since 2011 and down from 2.7 million in 2018.   ,Reports on housing, trade and consumer spending have suggested that the economic expansion, now in its 11th year, is not in immediate danger of being derailed by a recession. Worries that a downturn might be triggered by the Trump administration's 18-month-long trade war with China spurred the Fed to cut interest rates three times in 2019.  ,Indeed economic growth did slow last year, throttling back to 2.1% in the third quarter from 2018's brisk pace of nearly 3%. Now, though, with a Phase 1 deal with China set to be signed next week, policymakers are more confident in the outlook and last month signaled borrowing costs could remain unchanged at least through this year. Economists are pegging growth at the end of last year around a 2.3% rate. ,The dollar was little changed against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices rose. Stocks on Wall Street were mixed. ,The labor market has continued to churn out jobs at a healthy clip, despite anecdotal evidence of worker shortages, which economists had feared would significantly restrain hiring. But with the labor market tightening further, economists believe the long-awaited slowdown in job growth will happen this year. ,The unemployment rate declined by five-tenths of a percentage point in 2019. A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell to 6.7% in December, the lowest since the series started in 1994, from 6.9% the prior month. ,""Part of the challenge of adding new jobs this late in an expansionary period is that the number of available and qualified workers is dwindling,"" said Beth Akers, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute in New York.  ,The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, was steady at 63.2% last month.  ,Despite the tight labor market, wage inflation remains muted. Average hourly earnings rose three cents, or 0.1% last month, after gaining 0.3% in November. That lowered the annual increase in wages to 2.9% in December from 3.1% in November. ,That was the first drop below the 3% threshold since July 2018. Economists say some of the workers being hired require training, which is helping to keep wages contained. ,There were concerns about the average workweek, which was stuck at a relatively low 34.3 hours in the fourth quarter, the shortest since early 2011.  ,""A prolonged drop in hours worked signals that businesses may reduce hiring, with layoffs and cutbacks in private spending to follow,"" said Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at S&P Global Ratings in New York. ,Manufacturing employment dropped by 12,000 jobs in December after jumping 58,000 in November as the GM strike ended. Further declines are likely, with Boeing (,) suspending production of its troubled 737 MAX plane beginning this month.  ,Manufacturing added only 46,000 jobs in 2019 compared to 264,000 in 2018. The Institute for Supply Management's measure of national factory activity dropped in December to its lowest level since June 2009. ,Hiring at construction sites increased by 20,000 jobs in December. Government employment rose by 6,000 jobs and could accelerate in the coming months amid increased hiring for the 2020 Census. There were increases in leisure and hospitality,  financial activities, education and healthcare, retail and wholesale trade employment last month.  ,Professional and business services added the fewest jobs since January.

"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil fell below $65 a barrel on Friday in its first weekly loss since late November, erasing the week's risk premium added since a U.S. drone strike killed a top Iranian general as investors focused on rising U.S. inventories and other signs of ample supply.  ,However, markets were still eyeing the longer-term risks of conflict, and prices were briefly supported on Friday by new U.S. sanctions on Iran in retaliation for its missile attack on U.S. forces in Iraq this week. ,Also, a Russian navy ship ""aggressively approached"" a U.S. Navy destroyer in the North Arabian Sea on Thursday, the U.S. Navy's Bahrain-based Fifth Fleet said in a statement on Friday.     ,Brent crude LCOc1, the global benchmark, settled at $64.98, down 39 cents.

Still, production remains higher than the forecast demand for early 2020, according to some analysts.  ,But oil prices may find support in coming months due to improving fundamentals as the United States seems to have ""plateaued on production, and OPEC is sticking with its cuts,"" said Phil Streible, chief market strategist at Blue Line Futures in Chicago.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - From coast to coast, U.S. refineries are available for the taking, but nobody is buying. ,With the news that Royal Dutch Shell Plc is looking to unload its Anacortes, Washington, facility, there are seven different U.S. refineries on the block now, accounting for about 5% of U.S. crude oil processing capacity, according to data compiled by Reuters. ,U.S. energy production is at an all-time record, but there are concerns that refineries that don't attract buyers could suffer from lack of investment and maintenance that could lead to accidents down the road. ,These properties, from Washington state to Pennsylvania, are having trouble finding bidders because of unfavorable locales, worries about falling margins, and the coming restart of nearby facilities in the Caribbean that will add to competition, bankers and analysts said.  ,Just one U.S. refinery transaction closed last year: Chevron Corp's purchase of a Houston-area plant from Petrobras.  ,Prior to that, a flurry of corporate mergers saw independent refiners Alon, Western and Tesoro acquired by rivals. The consolidation left some acquirers, like Marathon Petroleum, with limited appetite or ability to consolidate the sector further.  ,""When some of your really big companies have stopped buying refineries, that really slows things down,"" said Matthew Blair, head of refiners equity research at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. ,In addition, new international shipping fuel regulations, known as IMO 2020, and the U.S. renewable fuels standard that requires refineries to blend biofuels into their gasoline pool, have proved a deterrent, as both are seen as potentially detrimental for refining margins.  ,Last week, Exxon Mobil Corp said fourth-quarter results would decline from the year-earlier period, citing weak margins in refining and chemicals. ,""Refiners don't want to get overleveraged if they're on the downside of the cycle where margins are eroding,"" said Matt Flanagan, downstream energy practice partner at Opportune, based in Houston. ,PBF Energy Inc announced plans to buy a San Francisco-area refinery from Shell in June, but that transaction has still not closed as expected. The company was not immediately available to comment.  ,CVR Energy Inc, which operates two refineries, said in an October conference call that it failed to find a buyer for the company due to valuation disagreements.  ,Valuations for refineries vary greatly - Blair suggests Shell's Anacortes refinery could fetch $500 million to $800 million, putting it significantly below the $1 billion price tag for the Martinez refinery.  ,East Coast assets have proven particularly tough to unload, as they lack both the scale of U.S. Gulf facilities and access to U.S. crude production. They also face competition from two shuttered Caribbean plants due to restart in coming months that have easier access to overseas crude and more flexible fuel distribution systems.   ,Philadelphia Energy Solutions put its 335,000-bpd refinery up for sale as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, and is expected to review bids in an auction next week. However, only one bidder has said it plans to revive refinery operations at the site, which shut last year after a fire. ,Delta Airlines retained bankers to help sell its Trainer, Pennsylvania refinery almost a year ago, but has not found a buyer.  ,Exxon Mobil's Billings, Montana, refinery, which has access to local crude and logistics systems, may not sell if a buyer is unwilling to pay a premium for the plant, people familiar with the process said. ,Beyond market risk, potential buyers must contend with environmental risk due to liability, and the possibility of high-profile disasters like last year's blaze at Philadelphia Energy Solutions.  ,""Refiners don't want to overpay for an asset with environmental liabilities that might require unknown capital expenditure to meet future requirements,"" Flanagan said. ,(This story has been refiled to change title in paragraph 10) ",Business News,1/10/2020 6:05,"U.S. refinery sales hit the brakes, with 5% of capacity on block"
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. stock market that has weathered trade wars, weak corporate earnings, and now a U.S.-Iran conflict to continually hit record highs faces a new obstacle: the 2020 U.S. election season. ,Investors are bracing for more volatility as soon as early February when Democratic voters in Iowa and New Hampshire kick off the primary season. Clues about which candidates will have momentum heading into next month will emerge on Tuesday, when the Democratic Party holds its next presidential debate. ,Stocks could retreat if a progressive candidate scores a few early victories or if seemingly more market-friendly moderates, such as former Vice President Joe Biden, fail to register much support. ,The market may face political uncertainty for months if it takes a long time to select the Democratic candidate, who would then face a hard-fought race against President Donald Trump before the November election. ,""Investors could potentially sit on the sidelines waiting for more clarity around the election,"" said Michael Arone, chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. ,""It wouldn't surprise me, especially coming off what has been a very solid year in markets, for investors to kind of take a wait-and-see approach,"" Arone added. ,After gaining about 29% in 2019, the benchmark S&P 500 , has kept pushing higher, minting fresh record highs on Thursday, as U.S.-Iran tensions appeared to have abated for now. ,Some investors still believe Wall Street is ripe for a pullback. ,""The domestic calendar for the primary season is going to be a source of volatility,"" said Alicia Levine, chief strategist at BNY Mellon Investment Management. ""I think the market will use it as an excuse to come in a little bit and take some heat out of the market and take some of the froth out of the market, depending on some of these outcomes."" ,Levine called the elections a ""sleeper issue"" because stocks are pricing in a market-friendly outcome.     ,Investors said they are weighing scenarios that would be relatively favorable for stocks overall. These include Trump's reelection and victory by a seemingly moderate Democratic candidate such as Biden or former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. ,But stocks could fall if U.S. senators Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, who are seen as more likely to push for increased regulations in areas such as healthcare and technology, and for wealth taxes, outperform in the primaries. ,""The more Joe Biden and other moderates are overtaken by the progressives, I think the market will very gradually begin to price in more headwinds,"" said Dave Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Investment Managers in Boston. ,Shares of healthcare companies were pressured last year by worries that Warren and Sanders would push through a government-run Medicare for All. Those fears have eased, but healthcare is one sector likely to face the election spotlight this year, along with technology, financials and energy. ,With no strong favorite currently, Trump's Democratic opponent may not be clear by March 3, when more than a dozen states vote on Super Tuesday. ,""Uncertainty is never good for the stock market,"" said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, who added that following Super Tuesday, ""you usually know who the candidates are going to be and this time around there's a good chance that you won't."" ,Another factor is control of Congress. Trump's Republican party holds the Senate, while Democrats have a grip on the House of Representatives - split control that investors say is relatively market friendly. ,But if there is a Democratic wave in November that also flips the Senate, stocks could be hit, investors said, as presidential and congressional control by one party could pave the way for major policy overhauls. ,""The most violent reaction would be to a progressive Democrat with the potential for control of Congress,"" Arone said.

"NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The last U.S. employment report of the 2010s out Friday had few surprises, but it wrapped up a decade that featured some notable milestones in a job market that has changed dramatically in the space of 10 years. ,The 2010s will go into the record books - for at least another 10 years - as the decade that saw the greatest number of jobs created in the United States: 22.6 million. ,It was a welcome recovery from the 2000s, the only decade in the history of Bureau of Labor Statistics data to feature a net loss of jobs, thanks largely to the two recessions that bookended that era. December's report was the 111th monthly scorecard in a row to show employment gains, and the U.S. economy ended the decade with a record 152.4 million people working. ,(GRAPHIC: A decade of record job creation - ,)      ,ULTRA-LOW UNEMPLOYMENT ,The headline unemployment rate of 3.5% matched a low from half a century ago and is roughly a third of the level at the start of the decade. ,A wider measure of unemployment - which counts Americans out of work, people involuntarily working part-time, and those just marginally attached to the workforce - fell to a record low in December. This so-called U-6 rate is down to 6.7% from a record-high 17.1% as the decade began. ,Still, one in five of those out of work stayed unemployed for half a year or more, a percentage more typically seen during recessions. ,(GRAPHIC: A gauge of U.S. unemployment is at a record low - ,) ,Factory employment fell 12,000 in December, but in the last 10 years it rebounded overall, with nearly 1.4 million production jobs created, the most since the 1960s and reversing a three-decade trend of losses. ,Total manufacturing employment, however, remains lower than before the Great Recession. ,Moreover, despite the recovery, factory positions continue to lose ground against services, where the vast majority of new jobs were created in the 2010s. Manufacturing's share of total U.S. employment ended the decade at just 8.4%, roughly a quarter of its peak share after World War II. ,(GRAPHIC: Manufacturing jobs bounced back in the 2010s - ,) ,With unemployment near a record and employers complaining about a lack of available workers, foreign-born residents might seem a natural choice to help fill the gap. ,But immigration restrictions from the Trump administration appear to be stymieing the growth of that labor pool.  ,December's payrolls report showed 170,000 fewer foreign-born workers employed than a year earlier, the fourth month in a row of year-over-year declines.

Some airlines now lack cash to take delivery, while several orders have also been deferred. ,Airbus data brought the 2019 book-to-bill ratio - or the ratio of net orders to deliveries - to 0.89, the lowest level since the financial crisis in 2009. ,Both Airbus and Boeing are however enjoying a buffer of some 8 years of deliveries at current production rates. ,Industry sources said the Synergy orders had already been written off with a value of zero in adjusted figures on the net value of outstanding business, under recent accounting rules. ,The cancellation is the latest headache for airline Avianca and its controlling company Synergy, which has struggled for years with long-standing debts to both Airbus and hedge fund Elliott Management.Synergy is owned by German Efromovich, a Bolivian-born aviation entrepreneur who bought Avianca out of bankruptcy in the early 2000s and grew it to become Latin America's No. 2 airline.  ,Last May, United Airlines took control of Synergy, ousting Efromovich from his own airline, due to a defaulted loan issued by the No. 3 U.S. carrier. ,Airbus said it had delivered more than 640 single-aisle A320-family jets in 2019, also confirming a Reuters report. ,It is expected to give forecasts for 2020 when it issues annual results at the end of January.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co (,) will revive the Hummer name to sell a new family of electric pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles and will tout the return with a Super Bowl ad featuring NBA star LeBron James, two people briefed on the matter said on Friday. ,The vehicles will be sold under the GMC nameplate. Reuters reported in October that GM planned to build a new family of premium electric pickup trucks at its Detroit-Hamtramck plant beginning in late 2021 and was considering reviving the Hummer name, citing several people familiar with the plans. ,The Wall Street Journal reported GM's decision to move forward earlier on Friday. GM declined to comment. ,The electric truck and SUV program is the centerpiece of a planned $3 billion investment in the Detroit-Hamtramck plant to make electric trucks and vans, and part of a broader $7.7 billion investment in GM's U.S. plants over the next four years that was part of a new contract signed with the United Auto Workers union last year. ,The investment moves the automaker into a part of the EV market that is largely untested and where GM has a higher likelihood of turning a profit, analysts said. ,Reuters reported GM plans to first build EV pickups in late 2021 and then an electric SUV in 2023. ,Tesla (,) CEO Elon Musk in November unveiled an electric pickup called ""Cybertruck"" it plans to build starting in late 2021. ,Rivian, a start-up electric company backed by Amazon.com (,), will begin building 100,000 electric delivery vans for Amazon starting in 2021. ,Hummers were rugged civilian utility vehicles with low gas mileage that were inspired by military vehicles and were popular with such celebrities as actor Arnold Schwarzenegger but derided by environmentalists as gas-guzzlers.

"(Reuters) - Alphabet's new Chief Executive Sundar Pichai on Friday gained the opportunity to reshape the leadership of Google's parent with the exit of Chief Legal Officer David Drummond, whose outsized strategic role was overshadowed by employee concerns about his personal relationship with a subordinate. ,Drummond, also senior vice president of corporate development, had been with Google since its start in 1998. He incorporated the company as outside counsel, winning the business of co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. He later spent nearly 18 years as the company's top lawyer and one of its few black executives. ,Scrutiny centered on Drummond as the board last year investigated the company's handling of sexual misconduct complaints throughout its workforce, and he became a lightning rod for criticism about what some employees viewed as tolerance for poor behavior.  ,Pichai now has his first big chance to make his mark on Alphabet leadership since Page and Brin left him day-to-day reins of the company last month. ,Drummond's last day is Jan. 31, and a replacement has not been decided yet, Alphabet said. ,""With Larry and Sergey now leaving their executive roles at Alphabet, the company is entering an exciting new phase, and I believe that it's also the right time for me to make way for the next generation of leaders,"" Drummond said in an email to employees shared by Google.  ,Some employees had questioned Drummond's role at the company after the New York Times in 2018 reported on an extramarital affair he had with subordinate, Jennifer Blakely, starting in 2004. She told the paper that she was effectively forced to transfer teams to comply with Google's workplace dating policy.  ,Blakely had a son with Drummond, but in August 2019 she publicly criticized him for not providing support. Drummond responded in a statement calling himself ""far from perfect."" Blakely did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. ,Some shareholders have urged Alphabet to make changes that had been within Drummond's purview, including greater financial transparency, bigger share buybacks and a management shakeup. Alphabet shares have risen 6.5% this month as analysts expressed optimism about possible changes. ,In a departure from company norm, Drummond is not receiving an exit pay package. In recent weeks, Drummond sold more than $200 million worth of his Alphabet shares, leaving him with about $90 million in company stock. ,He remains a defendant, alongside other executives, in a lawsuit shareholders brought last year accusing Alphabet leadership of covering up sexual harassment scandals within the company including by awarding lavish exit packages to two top executives found responsible for misconduct. ,""While we are glad to see Mr. Drummond is no longer with Alphabet, we still intend to hold him accountable for fiduciary breaches through our litigation,"" said Julie Goldsmith Reiser, attorney for the lead plaintiffs. ,The board completed an internal investigation last month, but has not publicized findings. The litigation is in mediation, and the board's findings and resulting actions may become known as it goes on. ,Pichai in 2018 said Google made mistakes in some cases and introduced new procedures aimed at creating equity and transparency in harassment investigations.  ,""I am fully committed to making progress on an issue that has persisted for far too long in our society… and, yes, here at Google, too,"" said Pichai, who at the time was Google CEO and had not yet gained the additional title of Alphabet CEO.  ,The #MeToo movement has forced major shake-ups in management and harassment policy across corporate America.  ,Through blog posts, congressional appearances and media interviews, Drummond's presence was felt in nearly every public battle the company fought as it crippled traditional businesses in media and telecoms on its way to online dominance. ,Drummond has described himself as a diversity advocate, telling Fortune in 2017 that he ""pushed"" the company to do more on the issue. He encouraged Google to publish data about the demographics of its workforce, and in 2014 he marched into a companywide meeting and spoke alongside colleagues frustrated by police violence against young black men.  ,When Google re-organized under the Alphabet umbrella in 2015, Page elevated Drummond's role beyond managing the company's legal and regulatory problems to overseeing its investment funds and far-off ventures. ,Earlier in his tenure, he beat a lawsuit lodged by insurer Geico that would have undermined the company's now-massive search ads business. He settled with Viacom (,) a copyright infringement lawsuit that could have crushed YouTube on its way to becoming the top online video destination. And he fended off five major book publishers to enable Google to make their copyrighted works searchable online. ,Drummond tussled on behalf of Google with rival Microsoft Corp (,)  for a decade on executive poaching, anticompetitive conduct and patents, with each company taking its share of licks.  ,As Google's lead dealmaker, Drummond oversaw billions of dollars' worth of acquisitions including of YouTube, DoubleClick and Motorola.  ,Drummond for a time served as the public face of strong stands against governments around the world. He has regularly advocated for freedoms of speech, and in 2010, he called for trade sanctions on countries that censor the internet, such as China and Turkey.

The two disasters killed 346. ,In particular, some of the communications reveal efforts by Boeing to avoid making pilot simulator training - an expensive and time-consuming process - a requirement for the 737 MAX. ,The plane maker just this week changed tack, saying it would recommend pilots do simulator training before they resume flying the 737 MAX - a major shift from its longheld position that computer-based training was sufficient as the plane was similar to its predecessor, the 737 NG. ,The release of the messages, which highlight an aggressive cost-cutting culture and disrespect towards the FAA, is set to deepen the crisis at Boeing which is struggling to get its best-selling plane back in the air and restore public confidence. ,The FAA said, however, that the messages do not raise new safety concerns although ""the tone and content of some of the language contained in the documents is disappointing"". ,Boeing said the communications ""do not reflect the company we are and need to be, and they are completely unacceptable"". ,For a factbox on excerpts from employees' messages, click , ,The disclosure, which Boeing said was in the interest of transparency with the FAA, prompted renewed outrage from U.S. lawmakers and puts more pressure on Boeing's new CEO David Calhoun to overhaul the company's culture when he takes the reins on Monday. ,House Transportation Committee Chairman Peter DeFazio, who has been investigating the MAX, said the messages ""paint a deeply disturbing picture of the lengths Boeing was apparently willing to go to in order to evade scrutiny from regulators, flight crews, and the flying public, even as its own employees were sounding alarms internally."" , Senator Roger Wicker, who chairs the commerce committee leading the senate's probe into Boeing, also said the latest documents ""raise questions about the efficacy of FAA's oversight of the certification process."" ,The U.S. Justice Department has an active criminal investigation underway into matters related to the 737 MAX plane.  ,Some of the messages pointed to problems with the simulators. Boeing said on Thursday it is confident ""all of Boeing's MAX simulators are functioning effectively"" after repeated testing since the messages were written.  ,The messages, however, show Boeing in the past was doing all it could to lobby aviation regulators to avoid the need for airlines to train pilots in a simulator on the differences between the 737 MAX and the 737 NG. ,""I want to stress the importance of holding firm that there will not be any type of simulator training required to transition from NG to MAX,"" Boeing's 737 chief technical pilot said in a March 2017 email.  ,""Boeing will not allow that to happen. We'll go face to face with any regulator who tries to make that a requirement."" ,Before the grounding, pilot training on the differences consisted of a one-hour lesson on an iPad and no time in the simulator, according to the union representing pilots at American Airlines. ,Shukor Yusof, the head of Malaysia-based aviation consultancy Endau Analytics, said Boeing should get credit for disclosing the ""destructive diatribes"". ,""Initially the flying public will understandably have reservations but the aircraft - having been completely and responsibly resurrected - will likely be one of the safest planes around,"" he said. ,In other emails and instant messages, employees spoke of their frustration with the company's culture, complaining about the drive to find the cheapest suppliers and ""impossible schedules"". ,""I don't know how to fix these things...it's systemic. It's culture. It's the fact we have a senior leadership team that understand very little about the business and yet are driving us to certain objectives,"" said an employee in an email dated June 2018. ,And in a May 2018 message, an unnamed Boeing employee said: ""I still haven't been forgiven by god for the covering up I did last year."" ,Without referencing what was covered up, the employee added: ""Cant do it one more time. the Pearly gates will be closed...""

Yet, earnings are seen climbing about 10% in 2020, and strategists say that growth is needed to sustain Wall Street's rally. ,""If the outlook we're getting for 2020 is similar (to 2019), maybe we will hit a point where investors decide to take a pause,"" said Michael O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut.

"(Reuters) - In just 12 days, Occidental Petroleum Corp pulled off one of the biggest hedges against falling oil prices ever placed by a U.S. energy company. It characterized the transaction as ""costless"" but a Reuters review of regulatory filings, market data and interviews shows that's not the whole story. ,The aim of the complex financial maneuver, the company said, was to help preserve Occidental's generous dividend to shareholders as it sought to take over rival Anadarko Petroleum for $38 billion last summer in the biggest industry deal for years. ,""With the additional leverage from the Anadarko acquisition, these new hedges will strengthen our 2020 cash flow in a low oil price environment, and provide additional assurance that our dividend is safe, while we are deleveraging,"" Occidental's Chief Financial Officer Cedric Burgher told an earnings call in August. ,However, to secure the hedge swiftly and discreetly and to avoid paying its bankers a fee for arranging it, the company took a bigger potential hit to future revenues with only limited protection against falling oil prices, according to a source with direct knowledge of the transaction.  ,While Occidental disclosed the financial details of the hedge in filings, fulfilling its regulatory obligations, the fact that the company took on the additional risk to secure the transaction fast and to avoid banker fees has not been previously reported. ,Occidental declined to comment for this story.  ,Hedges are used by a variety of companies. Airlines use them to protect against rising fuel prices and energy producers use them to lock in revenue, usually by buying a put option, a type of derivative contract, which gives them the right to sell oil at a predetermined future price. ,Occidental used a complex series of transactions for its hedge, which was arranged by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup, according to six sources with direct knowledge of the trades. The summer hedge covered nearly 110 million barrels of oil, or 300,000 barrels a day, each for 2020 and 2021, nearly enough to meet the annual oil imports of Australia. ,Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup declined to comment.   ,For a graphic on how the hedge was executed, click on [,]. ,The hedge meant the firm could sell the oil at a minimum of $55 a barrel in 2020, even if crude prices fell below that, to a limit of $45 a barrel; but the company's selling price was capped at $74.09, and it would lose out on any revenue earned from oil prices rising beyond that mark.  ,Occidental capped revenues for 2020 and also 2021 but only got downside protection for 2020 - a lopsided deal sometimes referred to as a naked hedge. Limiting future revenue without getting a guarantee against falling prices is unusual in the energy sector. ,While Occidental has disclosed the details of the 2020 hedge in regulatory filings, the absence of a hedge against falling oil prices in 2021 was not explicitly mentioned. The company said the 2021 options were meant to increase the maximum selling price it would receive for 2020 sales. ,""Occidental entered into the 2021 call options to substantially improve the ceiling price that the Company will receive for the contracted commodity volumes in 2020,"" it said in a filing. ,Some analysts said investors should have been given more information about the potential implications of the hedge. ,""It seems very strange that they left a naked hedge in 2021 which capped upside but offered no downside protection,"" said David Katz, president and CIO of Matrix Asset Advisors, which owns 0.3% of Occidental's shares. ,However, other analysts said Occidental needed to secure a hedge quickly to defuse some of the pressure from investors. ,""Doing this gives Oxy a lot of flexibility in 2020 with cash flow,"" said Trisha Curtis, President of PetroNerds, an energy analytics and advisory firm specializing in U.S. shale. ,""You can't have an acquisition that big and then willy-nilly hope that oil prices hold up. Regardless of what it cost them, it was needed for a number of reasons.""  ,(GRAPHIC: Breaking down Occidental's hedge - ,)     ,REVENUE-LIMITING OPTIONS ,Occidental has said publicly that it does not regularly hedge its oil sales because it does not want to give up potential revenue. The last time the company hedged was in 2005, also following an acquisition.  ,In the summer of 2019, Occidental was under pressure to demonstrate that its dividend was being protected. ,Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn was campaigning against the Anadarko deal and Anadarko itself had issued a regulatory filing on July 29 saying its calculations showed that Occidental, even without an acquisition, would not be able to generate enough cash to pay its dividend for the next three years. ,Occidental executives wanted to be able to announce the hedge to reassure investors when they presented second-quarter results on July 31, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the transaction.  ,Bank of America and Citigroup had been advising Occidental on the Anadarko acquisition. Now their traders had about two weeks to complete the hedge. ,Acting on Occidental's behalf, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup sold two types of derivative contracts, with the intention of using the proceeds from the sales to fund the purchase of a put option locking in Occidental's oil revenues at $55 a barrel for 2020, according to the six sources. ,In illiquid private markets, big transactions are more difficult, and therefore more expensive, to execute. If rival traders get wind of a deal before it is fully executed, they could get in first with their own buy or sell orders, pushing up or down the target price. ,In the case of Occidental's hedge, the large volume of oil and the tight time frame to insure it meant the banks were not going to be able to raise enough money from selling derivative contracts for 2020 alone to cover the cost of the hedge, the first source said.  ,To fill the gap and avoid having to present Occidental with a large bill, the banks sold similar revenue-limiting options for 2021, the source said. ,Selling the 2021 options also increased the amount of money the banks could make because they were selling additional contracts on Occidental's behalf. ,Derivatives trades require only minimal disclosure and it is unclear how much of a profit the banks made from the Occidental deal. ,Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup declined to comment. ,In the first week of 2020, international oil prices spiked by around 9% to nearly $72 a barrel due to heightened tensions in the Middle East. They have since fallen back to around $65, $2 above the price they are expected to average out at over 2020, according to the most recent Reuters poll. ,If those expectations pan out, Occidental will not miss out on potential profits, so the bet would work out. On the other hand, if oil prices were to surge again, and remain above $74 a barrel, the cost to Occidental could translate to millions of dollars a month in lost revenues, even at just $1 above the price cap.  ,Despite the hedge underpinning its dividend, Occidental shares have fallen by nearly a third since April, when its interest in Anadarko first became public.

But that's probably a fraction of the eventual costs. Analysts who have done the sums expect a drag as much as 0.4% this quarter on an economy already stuck in second gear. Given the bushfires have consumed an area 20 times greater than a similar conflagration in 2009, the cost will dwarf the $3 billion price attached to that disaster. ,Apocalyptic images of holiday-makers taking to the sea to escape flames could weigh heavy on tourism, which accounts for over 3% of Australia's economy. A policy reaction is likely; money markets are already pricing in monetary easing, flirting with an even chance of an interest rate cut in February. Last year, they had assigned a less than 30% probability. The Aussie dollar is down 2% so far in 2020. ,But the government has resisted linking the crisis to global warming. Its intransigence is likely to bring longer-term political costs. The fires add carbon emissions while decimating vital carbon-absorbing forests, so scientists are warning of more frequent and intense fires in future. ,(Graphic: 2019 was Australia's hottest and driest year since 1910 JPG - ,) ,2/CHINA - HOME AND ABROAD ,Chinese Vice Premier Liu He will finally hop on a plane to Washington from Jan. 13-15 to sign a long-awaited Phase 1 trade deal.

Trade figures on Tuesday are expected to show an increase in both imports and exports. And December's GDP reading due on Friday is forecast at the well-established 6% level. ,Across the Taiwan Strait meanwhile, Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen, who firmly opposes China's push to accept its ""one country, two systems"" model, scored a landslide re-election victory on Saturday.   ,Already a potential military flashpoint between Beijing and Washington, Taiwan's role in global high-tech supply chains was another reason to watch the election.

That's partly down to a strong quarter a year ago, but also to the drag from energy and industrials, which have borne the brunt of the trade war.  ,Banks may do better.

While there are signs of greater business confidence, last year was the weakest for UK retail sales since the mid-1990s, and industry and construction are languishing.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Consumer lending is expected to propel profits for big U.S. banks when they unveil fourth-quarter results this week, though stress in corporate lending and uneven capital markets may cast a shadow over results. ,Balances for individual borrowers keep reaching new records as the U.S. job market has stayed robust, prompting people to spend, and as interest rates have declined, prompting them to borrow — especially on credit cards. ,Overall, U.S. consumer-loan balances at the 25 largest banks  reached $1.19 trillion the last week of December, up 13% from a year earlier, according to Federal Reserve data. The biggest annual increase came from cards, where outstanding debt rose 16%. ,The banks held another $1.46 trillion in residential mortgage loans.  ,(GRAPHIC: U.S. consumer leverage declined as incomes rose - ,) ,That spells good news for quarterly profits at JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc, which have been working to grow their card businesses in recent years. The Fed's decision to lower rates in 2019 boosted mortgage activity, which will help major home lenders like Wells Fargo & Co. Those three banks are scheduled to report results on Tuesday. ,""The consumer-lending business is going to be very profitable for the banks,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Gerard Cassidy said in an interview. ,Americans borrowing to buy cars and pay for vacations has been a mainstay for industry profits recently. Consumer strength has helped offset weakness in trading, underwriting or business-loan demand at various points, with bank executives cheering it as a sign that the U.S. economy is not on the brink of recession.  ,Analysts expect tepid business borrowing to have continued through the fourth quarter. Global trade disputes, political uncertainties and market fluctuations have left CEOs wary of seeking financing to buy competitors or invest in operations, they said. ,However, those issues could take a back seat to the thriving U.S. consumer. ,As Americans' loan balances have climbed, their incomes have grown even faster. That debt is now about equal to disposable personal income after climbing to as much as one-third higher in 2007.  ,Analysts say they are also encouraged that banks appear to be lending more responsibly to consumers, partly due to new regulations. Consumer delinquency rates are low at 2.8%, compared with an average of 4.3% since 2003, according to Fed data. In the recession, the rate reached 8.2%.  ,However, analysts cautioned that credit mistakes often occur in the best of times and that it is hard to see them with the economy growing for the 11th straight year. ,Higher real-estate values have allowed property owners to raise cash by selling or refinancing. As competition has heated up in cards, some borrowers have been transferring zero-interest balances from one bank to another for a small fee, without paying off the debt. ,And although unemployment is at a 50-year low and wages are higher, there are still lots of consumers living paycheck-to-paycheck. ,A Fed survey last year found 39% of Americans would have a hard time handling an unexpected $400 expense. People with credit cards generally are not at such risk, but still about 16% said they would put the expense on a card. ,Fred Cannon, research director at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said a rise in unemployment in the next recession would expose bad loans. ""There certainly could be some problems,"" he said. ,(GRAPHIC: Consumers are making timely payments on their debt - ,)     ",Business News,1/13/2020 6:10,"As businesses hold back, U.S. consumers seen boosting big banks' profits"
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lovers of Champagne and other French sparkling wines should brace for big cost increases if the United States makes good on a threat to impose 100% tariffs on French goods in a dispute over the country's planned digital services tax. ,A $70 bottle of Moet & Chandon Grand Vintage could surge to $130, for example, said David Parker, chief executive of Benchmark Wine Group, the largest U.S. supplier of fine and rare wines for wine retailers.  ,The U.S. government said in December it may slap duties of up to 100% on $2.4 billion in imports from France of Champagne, handbags, cheese and other products over the tax, which it concluded would harm U.S. tech companies.  ,The Trump administration had already imposed 25% tariffs on many non-sparkling European wines in October in a dispute with the European Union over aircraft subsidies. It is separately reviewing whether to increase those duties and expand the list of products affected. ,Washington did not specify an effective date for the proposed duties, but the two countries have given themselves two weeks to try to resolve the tax row before officials meet at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in late January.  ,While the industry has largely absorbed the cost of the 25% tariffs imposed in October, it won't be able to do that if tariffs rise to 100%, industry executives say.  ,EU Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan will discuss these issues with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer when he visits Washington this week. ,If those efforts fail, the USTR's office could announce a new list of goods facing tariffs by late January, said Warren Maruyama, a partner at Hogan Lovells and former USTR general counsel. ,The looming tariffs pose the greatest threat to the wine industry since Prohibition, industry officials said in Washington last week, referring to the U.S. ban on the sale of alcoholic beverages from 1920 to 1933. ,Thanks to post-Prohibition regulation, the non-domestic U.S. wine business is divided into hundreds of importers, wholesalers and retailers. The 21st Amendment allows states to control the sale, distribution, taxation and importation of alcohol. ,""Because of the way Prohibition was repealed, essentially, every business in the wine business is a small business,"" said Benjamin Aneff, managing partner with Tribeca Wine Merchants.  ,An importer pays about $30 for a bottle of Moet & Chandon, plus transport, said Parker, who is also a member of the board of the National Association of Wine Retailers, adding a 25% markup before handing off to a distributor.  ,Distributors generally add an additional 25% markup, he said, then retailers tack on 20%, for the current price of $70.  ,If the original import price doubles to $60, U.S. wine businesses would be forced to pass along the increase, wine industry experts say.  ,American consumers simply will not tolerate that kind of price hike, Aneff said.  ,""We believe that for a huge percentage of this category, we're simply going to lose the revenue in the United States,"" he said, and estimated the industry could lose 50,000 jobs.       ,The United States is the largest foreign market for French wine, importing nearly 700 million euros ($771.54 million) of French sparkling wine per year, according to the Fédération des Exportateurs de Vins & Spiritueux de France (FEVS) trade group. ,If the U.S. market for Champagne weakens due to higher prices, French producers can easily sell their products in Asia and South America, where demand is growing rapidly, experts say.  ,By definition Champagne can only be produced in the northern French region of the same name. ,U.S. vintners make sparkling wines that perform , well against Champagne in blind taste tests. But there is no current surplus of U.S. wine production, and it takes seven to 10 years before a new vineyard matures and can produce good wines, experts say. ,The U.S. Trade Representative's office is accepting public comments on the French tax issue through Tuesday, and an expanded list of European products that could face tariffs under the WTO aircraft subsidy issue through Monday. ,It is not expected to act on either issue before the upcoming meetings with EU and French officials. ,But Robert Tobiassen, president of the National Association of Beverage Importers, said there was little hope of averting higher tariffs since the Trump administration continues to view them as a linchpin of its trade policies. ,""I believe the existing tariffs will continue and there is a very strong likelihood that other tariffs will come on,"" he said. ""They have their strategy."" ",Business News,1/13/2020 11:05,U.S. Champagne drinkers should expect costs to pop with new tariffs
"BEIJING (Reuters) - The Phase 1 trade deal to be signed this week by China and the United States ""stops the bleeding"" but does not end the trade war, a senior U.S. Chamber of Commerce official said on Monday, warning that significant challenges remain.  ,Myron Brilliant, the chamber's Executive Vice President, told a media briefings in the Chinese capital that there is ""clearly a sigh of relief from both sides"" with the agreement, expected to be signed on Wednesday in Washington, and that the depth of the Phase 1 was more positive than initially thought.  ,""Implementation of Phase 1 will be important to building trust and certainty, building off the success of the negotiation,"" said Brilliant, who said he had been briefed on the text of the accord but not seen it.  ,But while the Phase 1 accord ""stops the bleeding"", he said.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China's commitments in the Phase 1 trade deal with the United States were not changed during a lengthy translation process and will be released this week as the document is signed in Washington, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday. ,Mnuchin told Fox News Channel that the deal reached on Dec. 13 still calls for China to buy $40 billion to $50 billion worth of U.S. agricultural products annually and a total of $200 billion of U.S. goods over two years.   ,""It wasn't changed in translation.

Let me just say, it is $200 billion of additional products across the board over the next two years, and, specifically in agriculture, $40 billion to $50 billion."" ,Thus far, Beijing has not confirmed those purchase commitments, and recent government actions , in the agriculture industry have raised questions over the $40 billion to $50 billion target cited repeatedly by Trump administration officials. ,Chinese officials have been careful not to publicly discuss details of the Phase 1 deal, because Washington has changed its position multiple times during negotiations, three Chinese officials with knowledge of the situation told Reuters last week. ,Signing of the trade deal on Wednesday eases Trump's 18-month trade war aimed at altering China's trade and economic practices, but will leave in place tariffs on about $370 billion worth of Chinese imports per year. ,Those are expected to be addressed in Phase 2 negotiations, which the Trump administration wants to launch this year, covering thornier issues untouched by the Phase 1 trade deal, including Beijing's heavy subsidies to Chinese state-owned enterprises and restrictions digital trade and cybersecurity issues.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - As the bull market in U.S. stocks hits new highs, some investors are searching for ways to pare their exposure to the small group of technology and communications stocks that has fueled market gains for years.  ,The market's most crowded individual stocks are Microsoft (,), Amazon (,), Facebook (,), Visa (,) and Mastercard (,), according to a recent analysis by research firm Bernstein incorporating factors such as institutional ownership and price momentum. ,Just four stocks - Apple (,), Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon - generated more than 20% of the S&P 500's total return last year, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices. Fund managers in a Bank of America Merrill Lynch report in December tagged technology stocks as the market's ""most crowded"" trade. ,While few see a clear reason for their run to end, some money managers worry the market's leaders have become richly valued and overstretched, leaving them vulnerable to a sudden reversal in risk appetite.  ,""I think most investors… are going to be very surprised by how much risk is in their portfolios when you do get an environmental shift,"" said Damien Bisserier, partner at Advanced Research Investment Solutions, a Los-Angeles based management and consulting firm managing $13 billion in assets. ,The firm has sought to reduce its exposure to potential market volatility by investing in strategies it believes will be less-correlated with stocks, such as funds providing income through healthcare royalties or private real estate investments. ,The dilemma is one that's confronted investors at various times during the last several years. Many have found that limiting exposure to stocks tends to hurt their portfolio's performance in the long run. Doing so now, as worries over global growth, trade and a no-deal Brexit appear to be easing, may be especially difficult. ,At the same time, most analysts believe the S&P is unlikely to approach last year's 29% gain as receding global growth fears push some central banks to roll back their easing policies. A Reuters poll of 52 strategists in late November showed a median forecast of 3,260 for the S&P 500 by the end of 2020. The index recently traded at 3,275.7. ,Others are concerned that stretched valuations and an accumulation of funds in a limited number of bets could stoke violent market swings if investors try to sell all at once.  ,The S&P 500 information technology sector trades at a 12-month forward price-to-earnings ratio of 21.53, according to Refinitiv data. For the S&P 500, the same measure stands at 18.26. ,    A short-lived reality check came last Tuesday evening, when reports of an Iranian missile attack on a U.S. base sparked a sharp sell-off in stock futures and a rush into gold and other destinations.  ,A sudden jump in trade tensions or political uncertainty ahead of U.S. elections in November are other factors that could roil markets. ,A recent lull in volatility has exacerbated those concerns. Through Thursday, the S&P 500 index has gone 59 days without a one-day move of 1 percent in either direction, the longest such streak of stock market calm in more than a year. ,The last such period of calm stretched from June through October 2018 and ended with a flare-up of trade tensions that shaved 5% from the S&P in a two-day span. ,Kevin Dennean, technology analyst at UBS Global Wealth Management, gradually reduced exposure to the technology sector last year, wary of growing valuations and demand for products such as smartphones.  ,""We went underweight.

"PARIS/TOKYO (Reuters) - Renault shares hit six-year lows on Monday as investors worried the French automaker's 20-year cost-sharing alliance with Nissan is headed for a break-up without Carlos Ghosn to hold it together. ,Long-standing tensions in the Franco-Japanese partnership  have been heightened since Ghosn's arrest in Tokyo in November 2018 on allegations of financial misconduct, which he denies. ,Following a dramatic flight from Japanese justice late last month, Ghosn called the alliance a ""masquerade"" during a press briefing last week. ,A Financial Times report on Monday that Nissan executives are making contingency plans for a split with Renault appeared to accelerate a sell-off in the French manufacturer's shares. ,At 1528 GMT, Renault shares were down 3.2%, the biggest faller on Paris' CAC 40 index. The shares have lost more than a third of their value since Ghosn's arrest and his subsequent ouster as head of the alliance. ,Ghosn's attacks and the loss of confidence among investors have caught Renault and Nissan management in the middle of transitions to new chief executives.  ,The companies are trying to forge solutions to problems with their long-standing partnership, and launch new joint industrial projects, people familiar with the situation said. So far, those efforts haven't produced visible results. ,Alliance relations were further strained last year by Renault's failed attempt to merge with Fiat Chrysler. But the roots of the tensions go back years. ,A major sticking point since 2015 has been the equal division of costs for R&D into new technology and products, two sources close to Nissan said. ,That strategy ""did not compensate Nissan's work properly: Nissan's engineering output was 40% better, meaning Nissan engineers on average produced 40% more than their Renault counterparts in a given amount of time spent on a job,"" said one of the sources. ,""When measured more strictly, Nissan's output in some cases was double Renault's,"" he said. ,Nissan has asked for an analysis of the workloads and productivity of Renault and Nissan staffs, one person familiar with the situation said. ,The companies hope changes at the top could mark a reset for the partnership, but people familiar with the situation said divisions within Nissan's senior management are complicating efforts to fix the alliance and launch new projects.  ,Renault is in the process of choosing a new CEO after ousting Thierry Bollore in October and late last year Nissan picked Makoto Uchida, known for having close ties with Renault, as CEO. ,Some developments set in motion during the Ghosn era are due to come to fruition in 2020 - Nissan's crossover electric car, based on its Ariya concept model, will be the first to launch on the two firms' new joint electric platform, and in 2021 a Renault equivalent should also take shape. ,Jean-Dominique Senard, who joined Renault from tyre maker Michelin as chairman in early 2019 after Ghosn's arrest, has vowed to get the alliance working by this year, although the firms have yet to present new common initiatives. ,""The problem is today, there's nothing concrete as we look ahead, no goals,"" a former senior employee at Renault said.     ,(Graphic: Renault and Nissan shares click, ,) ",Business News,1/13/2020 10:37,Renault shares fall on worries Nissan alliance doomed without Ghosn

They alleged that several of Amazon and Flipkart's preferred sellers were affiliated with, or controlled by, the companies themselves, either directly or indirectly. ,In its 11-page order, the CCI noted four alleged anti-competitive practices: exclusive launch of mobile phones by the e-commerce firms, promoting preferred sellers on their websites, deep discounting practices and prioritising some seller listings over others. ,""Exclusive launch (of mobile phones) coupled with preferential treatment to a few sellers and the discounting practices create an ecosystem that may lead to an appreciable adverse effect on competition,"" the order said. ,The CCI said its investigation unit should complete the probe within 60 days, but typically such cases have taken far longer. ,Walmart in 2018 invested $16 billion to buy a majority stake in India's Flipkart, its biggest ever deal.  ,The CCI probe will be the latest setback for the U.S. companies that were last year hit with more stringent foreign investment rules.  ,Some of the allegations reviewed by the CCI have been long levelled against both companies. ,Indian brick-and-mortar traders allege Amazon and Flipkart violate the country's foreign investment rules and burn billions of dollars to offer steep discounts that hurt smaller traders.

"(Reuters) - The Trump administration has made it harder for employees of fast-food restaurants or other big franchises to sue corporations when individual franchise owners violate wage laws, a step that was a top priority for business groups. ,The U.S. Department of Labor on Sunday issued a rule that will make it more difficult to prove companies are liable for wage law violations of their contractors or franchisees. The rule takes effect in March, and should help franchisors who have been sued by workers in recent years for wage-law violations by franchisees. ,McDonald's Corp has faced a series of high-profile lawsuits claiming it is a so-called ""joint employer"" of franchise workers. The company won a major victory in October when a federal appeals court in San Francisco said McDonald's was not liable for alleged wage-law violations by a franchise owner.  ,In 2017, the department repudiated legal guidance from the  Obama administration that had expanded circumstances in which a company could be considered a so-called joint employer under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). ,Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia in a statement said the rule furthers President Donald Trump's effort to address regulations that hinder economic growth.  ,""By giving greater clarity to businesses who want to work together, we promote an entrepreneurial culture that has driven American prosperity for decades,"" Scalia said. ,Unions and worker advocacy groups had opposed the rule after the Labor Department proposed it last April. The union-backed National Employment Law Project said on Monday that the rule would allow companies to avoid liability even when they have some control over working conditions, and would prevent many workers from recouping pay they are owed under the FLSA.  ,The rule returns to an earlier four-part test under which companies are considered joint employers only if they hire, fire, and supervise employees, set pay, and maintain employment records. That would likely exclude many franchisors and companies that hire contract labor. ,The Obama administration's guidance included several other factors, such as the nature of the work being performed and whether workers were integral to a company's business. The business community complained that approach threatened the franchise business model and would lead to a spike in lawsuits. ,Robert Cresanti, president of the International Franchise Association, a trade group, said in a statement the Obama-era guidance was ""one of the nation's most harmful economic regulations"" and had nearly doubled the number of lawsuits filed against franchise businesses.  ,The Obama-era regulation was not legally binding, unlike the rule released on Sunday. That could make it more difficult for future administrations to undo, but also could open it up to legal challenges. ,The National Labor Relations Board is moving to roll back a separate Obama-era standard for determining joint employment under federal labor law, which governs union organizing and workers' rights to advocate for better working conditions.

""There's nothing for miners to fear in this development.""  ,Inside a nondescript warehouse on the outskirts of Austin, Texas, Apple's Daisy robot breaks apart iPhones so that 14 minerals, including lithium, can be extracted and recycled.  ,Apple is already using recycled tin, cobalt and rare earths in some of its products, with plans to add to that list. The company last month bought the first commercial batch of carbon-free aluminum from a joint venture between Rio Tinto (,) and Alcoa (,). ,Daisy, less than 20 yards in length, uses a four-step process to remove an iPhone battery with a blast of -80 degree Celsius (-112°F) air, and then pop out screws and modules, including the haptic module that makes a phone vibrate.   ,The components are then sent off to recyclers for the minerals to be extracted and refined. Daisy can tear apart 200 iPhones per hour. Apple chose the iPhone to be the first of its products that Daisy would disassemble because of its mass popularity, said Jackson. ,Apple is considering sharing the Daisy technology with others, including electric automakers. Daisy does have its skeptics, including some in the tech world who want the company to focus more on building products that can be repaired, not just recycled. ,""There's this ego that believes they can get all their minerals back, and it's not possible,"" said Kyle Wiens, chief executive of iFixit, a firm advocating for electronics repair, rather than replacement. ,That may partially explain why the mining industry isn't worried.     ,""Apple is in an enviable position, because they can do this,"" said Tom Butler, president of the International Council on Mining and Metals, an industry trade group. ""Not everyone else will be able to follow suit."" ",Technology News,1/10/2020 18:42,Apple pushes recycling of iPhone with 'Daisy' robot
"(Reuters) - Charles Scharf will make his public debut as Wells Fargo & Co's (,) chief executive during the bank's quarterly earnings call on Tuesday, and those who have worked with him in the past say he is likely to strike a much different chord than his predecessors. ,For years, Wells CEOs spoke with Midwestern lilts and have sprinkled their public events with folksy anecdotes. John Stumpf, who ran the San Francisco-based bank from 2007 to 2016, spoke publicly about being raised on a Minnesota farm with 10 siblings, and once recounted his own experience being upside down on a mortgage during the foreclosure crisis in 2010. Tim Sloan, who took over the reins as the bank's fake accounts scandal unraveled, once brought his family, including grandchildren, on stage at a shareholder meeting in Iowa.  ,But Scharf is not known for such pleasantries, several analysts who have worked with him said. ,He tended to give short, blunt answers when he was CEO of Visa Inc (,) and Bank of New York Mellon Corp (,), or when he was a senior executive at JPMorgan Chase & Co (,), they said, noting that he is not shy about showing annoyance if he does not appreciate a question or comment. ,""He's not polite necessarily,"" said MoffettNathanson analyst Lisa Ellis, who covers Visa. ,""His bedside manner needs improvement,"" said RBC Capital Markets analyst Gerard Cassidy, who interacted with Scharf at BNY Mellon. ,""He has a straight-between-the-eyes kind of delivery,"" said Argus Research analyst Stephen Biggar, who has followed Scharf at each of his companies so far. ,A Reuters review of a dozen transcripts for conference calls Scharf led in previous jobs offered a glimpse of his tendencies. He started sentences with phrases like, ""As I've said many times,"" or ""As I know you already know,"" when he seemed to think questions were repetitive. He frequently directed analysts to do their own math, rather than offering guidance. ,Wells Fargo declined to comment for this story. ,Analysts who cover Wells Fargo said they will appreciate directness in a CEO, after years of feeling whipsawed by a sales scandal whose breadth and consequences have taken unexpected turns. Prior management teams initially downplayed the extent of the problems, and how they might affect profits, regulatory relationships and Wells Fargo's reputation with customers. (,) ,Although associates say Scharf can be blunt at times, they also view him as knowledgeable, honest and experienced. Some compared him to his one-time mentor, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, who is known to speak his mind. (,) ,""There's a bit of Jamie Dimon in him I would have to say,"" Biggar said.  ,Scharf may be the first Wells Fargo CEO with more credentials on Wall Street than Main Street. In hiring him, the bank's board agreed to let the native New Yorker keep his main work location in Manhattan, though Wells Fargo is based in San Francisco, with big hubs in Minneapolis and Charlotte, North Carolina.  ,Analysts do not expect Scharf to give off the same vibe as his predecessors — though they said he may make an extra effort to be courteous, given the amount of attention Wells Fargo receives. In his first internal town hall as Wells Fargo CEO, Scharf painted himself as a family man.  ,""I don't expect too much oomph,"" said Vining Sparks analyst Marty Mosby.

"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Maersk (,), the world's biggest shipping company, plans to focus on premium services such as cold storage and digital solutions to avoid competing with its own freight-forwarding clients as it expands in the land transportation business. ,Since announcing a new strategy in 2016, which included selling its oil and gas business, Maersk has focused less on market share and more on profitability and cost-cutting in its container and logistics business. ,It now hopes to see its terminal and inland logistics operations, the non-Ocean business, make up a bigger part of its future earnings. In 2018, the ocean transport business accounted for almost 80% of core earnings. ,While Maersk moves around one in five containers shipped at sea, it handles land transportation from ports to warehouses and distribution centers for less than a quarter of its customers. ,Speaking to reporters on Monday, chief executive of APM Terminals and member of Maersk's executive board, Morten Engelstoft, said Maersk had room to ""catch up"" with rival shippers in its land transportation business.  ,""Compared to the other shipping lines, our share of the inland business is lower percentage-wise,"" Engelstoft said. ,Rather than investing in freight trucks and threatening the core business of large freight forwarding companies - many of whom are Maersk's own customers -  Engelstoft pointed to so-called 'cold chains' as a more attractive investment.    ,Transporting goods in a 'cold chain' means keeping perishable goods, like fruits or meat, refrigerated throughout the entire journey in order to keep goods fresh for longer.  ,Engelstoft mentioned that Costa Rica, a major exporter of pineapples and bananas, could benefit from a cold chain between its banana plantations and Maersk's recently inaugurated container terminal on its Caribbean coast. ,Maersk is keen to avoid eating into its customers' land transportation businesses as it develops more end-to-end customized solutions. It risks taking business from some of the world's biggest freight-forwarders like DHL Logistics, Kuehne & Nagel (,), DSV Panalpina (,) and DB Schenker.  ,""Of course, Maersk needs to keep an eye on the fact, that a large part of our business is for freight forwarders,"" Engelstoft said.  ,""The primary focus in the new Maersk is not the traditional freight forwarding business. We are much more interested in things like cold stores, data and digital solutions,"" he added. ",Business News,1/13/2020 18:43,Maersk bets on cold storage to boost land transportation business
"(Reuters) - When Citigroup Inc (,) combined businesses that cater to big companies in 2018, management wanted dealmakers, traders and traditional corporate bankers to combine forces and propel Citi toward the top of Wall Street market-share rankings. ,The third-largest U.S. bank has made some progress. Its overall market share across advisory, syndicate lending and equity and debt origination edged up to 5.1%, from 4.9% in 2018. But Citi's rankings in those business lines were unchanged in 2019, according to Dealogic data. ,In December, bankers from Citigroup's capital markets, investment banking and corporate lending teams gathered for their first full-year review meetings since the groups were combined. The tone in the meetings was positive, executives said, but after a year of stagnant rankings the unit still has a lot of work to do.   ,Citigroup has struggled to gain traction since it has yet to snatch away meaningful market share from powerful incumbents like JPMorgan Chase & Co (,), Goldman Sachs Group Inc (,), and Morgan Stanley (,).  ,And, as it moves along with its strategy in 2020, the outlook is not great, industry insiders and analysts said. ,Trade wars, recession fears and international events — ranging from Brexit to Hong Kong protests to political chaos in Venezuela to the United States killing an Iranian leader this month — have unpredictable outcomes that affect prices of goods and services in local markets, as well as global companies' ability to acquire or transact between them. ,The geopolitical uncertainty is also keeping some corporate clients, who would otherwise be looking for deals or other financing, on the sidelines, executives have said. ,However, Citi's expertise as a deeply international bank that helps companies grow and do business across borders, may not position them well for the current business trends, said Marty Mosby analyst at stock broker-dealer Vining Sparks. ,""The world that was becoming more and more integrated is becoming less integrated and becoming a little bit more isolated,"" he said. ""And that's not to Citigroup's advantage."" ,The values of global dealmaking and initial public offerings industry wide are each expected to drop more than 20% this year according to estimates by law firm Baker McKenzie.  ,""The investment banking business has never been more demanding,"" said Tyler Dickson, the New York-based co-head of Citi's Banking Capital Markets and Advisory group.  ,Citigroup has prided itself on being the most global of the big banks for decades, but after the 2007-2009 financial crisis, it pulled back from many regions and businesses. Even so, the bank still operates in 98 countries, partly to ensure that multinational clients have access to markets in which they operate. ,Citigroup executives say they can win business from big corporations, even if the overall industry revenue pie shrinks. ,Last year, the bank was able to grow the transaction value of the deals it advised by 11% despite the wallet being down 2% for the industry, according to Refinitiv data. Citigroup can still capture market share even with bleak 2020 outlook, Dickson said. ,Dickson is co-head alongside Manolo Falco, who is based in London. On the first anniversary of their professional marriage, the two sent balloons and a cake, respectively, to the other's office to celebrate a job well done.  ,The bank is focused on getting more business from existing corporate customers and adding new companies that fit into a certain rubric, executives told Reuters. ,That includes technology and healthcare companies, as well as small-but-promising startups that might grow fast. ,But the bank is not looking to gain share among smaller mid-sized companies that competitors including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America or Goldman Sachs are targeting. ,""Between the two growth paths, I like that path better,"" said Cary Kochman, Citi's co-head global head of M&A.

"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Oil prices fell about 1% on Monday as Middle East tensions eased and investors turned their focus to lackluster seasonal demand following last week's bearish U.S. report showing a large fuel stockbuilds. ,Brent crude LCOc1 settled down 78 cents at $64.20 per barrel. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 settled at $58.08 a barrel, down 96 cents.  ,Thin U.S. refinery margins for petroleum products have sapped crude prices, particularly as winter demand for heating oil has disappointed suppliers and gasoline margins have weakened, analysts said.  ,""It's hard for crude oil to go higher if refiners continue to lose money or at best break even on gasoline,"" said Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis at the Oil Price Information Service (OPIS).  ,U.S. gasoline stocks rose by the most in one week in four years, surging by 9.1 million barrels in the week to Jan. 3,  the U.S. Energy Information Administration reported last week. Total motor gasoline inventories were about 5% above the five-year average for this time of year, it said.  ,Distillate stockpiles, which include diesel and heating oil, rose by 5.3 million barrels in the week, versus expectations for a 3.9 million-barrel rise, the data showed. ,On Monday, the U.S. heating oil crack spread HOc1-CLc1, a measure of the profit margin for refining crude into diesel or heating oil, fell to $21.56, the weakest in almost five months.  ,""Heating oil has been the worst performer in the middle of winter, when it's supposed to be the best.

"(Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve officials may be in broad agreement that interest rates are unlikely to change soon, but they differed Monday on how concerned they are about developing financial risks in assessing when a rate hike might be appropriate. ,Atlanta Federal Reserve bank president Raphael Bostic said that for him there is a ""high bar"" for any rate increase until inflation moves convincingly to the Fed's 2% target, and that evidence of excessive borrowing or financial instability in the economy would have to be ""systemic"" for him to think otherwise. ,""It is going to be a pretty high bar for us to make policy more contractionary,"" Bostic said in remarks to the Rotary Club of Atlanta. ""We are going to want to let the economy run and run hot enough to where inflation starts to move and gets us to a place where we are comfortable that level is not a threat to expectations."" ,Expectations among businesses and households that inflation will fall is considered a precursor to weak prices and slow growth of the sort that has beset Japan. ,After roughly eight years in which the pace of price increases has been below the central bank's 2% target, Fed officials say they take seriously the risk that they could lose public confidence. ,However Boston Federal Reserve bank President Eric Rosengren argued Monday that the central bank needs to stay on guard both to an inflation surprise and to the possibility that continued cheap borrowing costs could overinflate asset values, particularly in real estate, and set the stage for a collapse. ,Rosengren last year dissented against the Fed's three rate cuts. He noted Monday that even if inflation seems currently weak, the Fed has little experience analyzing the economy when unemployment and interest rates are both abnormally low. ,""Central bankers do not have much historical experience with extended periods where interest rates are running below the estimated equilibrium level while unemployment rates are, simultaneously, historically low,"" Rosengren said in a speech in Hartford, Connecticut. ""So we want to be alert to any potential risks emerging.""  ,Neither Rosengren nor Bostic have a vote on monetary policy this year. ,Deciding how to analyze financial risks and how much weight to put on them will be a key point of debate in coming months at the central bank. ,At a recent economics conference, former Fed Chair Janet Yellen called for the Fed to develop alternate tools to address financial stability concerns so that interest rate decisions could be based on the behavior of unemployment and inflation - the Fed's two congressionally mandated responsibilities. In the current environment that would likely mean leaving rates low in order to encourage businesses and households to spend, and thus support continued job growth. ,After cutting rates three times last year, Fed officials say they are indeed unlikely to raise or lower borrowing costs again unless there is a significant change in the direction of the economy. While that is the consensus view, there are those,  like Rosengren, who argue that higher rates might be appropriate to guard against a worse outcome down the road by preventing risky borrowing.  ,Bostic said he agrees that is a concern. But in conversation with bankers and investors in his district, he says any trouble spots still seem isolated.  ,""What I ask every day: Are you seeing concentrations of risk taking? Is there something going on I need to be worried about?"" he said. ""Almost all say it is, like, one neighborhood in one city but nothing that seems to be bleeding across.""

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department on Monday dropped its designation of China as a currency manipulator days before top officials of the world's two largest economies were due to sign a preliminary trade agreement to ease an 18-month-old tariff war. ,The widely expected decision came in a long-delayed semi-annual currency report, reversing an unexpected move by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last August at the height of U.S.-China trade tensions.  ,Mnuchin had accused China of deliberately holding down the value of its yuan currency to create an unfair trade advantage, just hours after President Donald Trump, angered at the lack of progress in trade negotiations, had also accused China of manipulating its currency. ,The Treasury Department had not labeled China a currency manipulator since 1994. Beijing had recently met just one of the department's three criteria needed for such a designation - a large bilateral trade surplus with the United States.   ,In its latest currency report, the Treasury said that as part of the Phase 1 trade deal, China had made ""enforceable commitments to refrain from competitive devaluation"" and agreed to publish relevant data on exchange rates and external balances. ,Chinese Vice Premier Liu He arrived in Washington on Monday for a White House ceremony to sign the trade deal with Trump. People familiar with the negotiations said that although the manipulator designation had no real consequences for Beijing, its removal was an important symbol of goodwill for Chinese officials. ,U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer on Monday told Fox Business that the translation of the U.S.-China trade agreement was almost completed and the text of the deal would be made public on Wednesday before the ceremony. ,The currency report said the Chinese yuan, also known as the renminbi, had depreciated as far as 7.18 per U.S. dollar in early September, but had rebounded in October and was currently trading at about 6.93 per dollar. ,""In this context, Treasury has determined that China should no longer be designated as a currency manipulator at this time,"" the report said.  ,It said, however, China should take decisive steps to avoid a persistently weak currency and allow greater market openness to strengthen its long-term growth prospects. ,There was no immediate reaction from Beijing. In August, China's central bank denied it had intervened to weaken the yuan, and said Washington's designation of China as a currency manipulator seriously harmed international rules. ,Mark Sobel, a former senior Treasury official and adviser to the London-based OMFIF economy policy think tank, said China ""was errantly designated at a moment of presidential pique.""  ,""It should never have happened in the first place,"" he said.  ""China manages, but does not manipulate its currency."" ,Sobel said China's current account surplus was small as a share of gross domestic product and it had not intervened in currency markets for years. The August move came at a time when the yuan had fallen against the dollar because of market apprehension over Trump's ""ratcheting up of trade tariffs,"" he said. ,The Treasury report also cited continued concerns about the currency practices of eight other countries - Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea and Vietnam - and added a ninth, Switzerland, to its list. ,It raised particular concerns about Germany, the world's fourth largest economy, which it said continued to have the world's largest current account surplus and was slipping into recession. It said the German government had a responsibility to undertake tax cuts and boost domestic investment. ,The Treasury report said the continued strength of the U.S. dollar was ""concerning,"" given the International Monetary Fund's judgment that the dollar was overvalued on a real effective basis. ,It said the real dollar remains about 8% above its 20-year average, noting that sustained dollar strength would likely exacerbate persistent trade and current account imbalances for the United States. ,U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, a fierce critic of China's currency and trade practices, blasted the Trump administration for its decision to ""back down"" from labeling China a currency manipulator. ,""China is a currency manipulator - that is a fact,"" Schumer said in a statement. ""Unfortunately, President Trump would rather cave to President Xi (Jinping) than stay tough on China."" ,The yuan , reached five-month highs earlier on Monday ahead of the expected signing of the trade deal.

"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's exports rose for the first time in five months in December and by more than expected, signaling a modest recovery in demand as Beijing and Washington agreed to defuse their prolonged trade war.  ,The world's largest economies are set to sign a Phase 1 trade deal on Wednesday, marking a significant de-escalation but not an end to a dispute that has rattled financial markets and threatened to derail global economic growth. ,After a rough year, China's exports ended 2019 on an upbeat note, rising 7.6% in December from a year earlier, customs data showed on Tuesday. The median forecast from a Reuters poll of analysts had been for a 3.2% rise in shipments, following November's 1.3% drop. ,Imports also beat expectations, jumping 16.3% from a year earlier, though boosted in part by higher commodity prices. The Reuters poll had forecast 9.6% growth versus 0.5% in November. ,While comparisons with a weak December last year flattered both figures, they also pointed to improving demand, both globally and within China, analysts said. ,China posted a trade surplus of $46.79 billion in December, compared with the poll's forecast for a $48 billion surplus and up from November's surplus of $37.93 billion. ,For all of 2019, its total exports proved remarkably resilient to trade tensions, rising 0.5%, though that was well off a near 10% gain in 2018, reflecting weaker U.S. sales.  ,Imports fell 2.8% last year as China's economic growth cooled to near 30-year lows, after rising 15.8% in 2018.    ,China's better-than-expected trade numbers come amid a flurry of trust-building gestures from both sides ahead of the signing of the Phase 1 deal.  ,The U.S. Treasury Department said on Monday China should no longer be designated a currency manipulator - a label it applied as the yuan currency dropped in August. ,On Tuesday, China's customs vice minister Zou Zhiwu told a briefing that its soybean and pork imports from the U.S. rebounded significantly in December and positive trade sentiment has boosted companies' confidence. ,But overall growth in imports from the U.S. saw less of an pick-up than shipments from other countries in December, analysts from Capital Economics said in a note. ,China's trade surplus with the United States for December stood at $23.18 billion, according to Reuters calculations based on customs data, down from November's surplus of $24.60 billion. ,China exports to the United States fell 12.5% in 2019, compared with a rise of 11.3% in 2018. Imports from the United States fell 20.9%, versus a 0.7% rise in the previous year. ,Overall sentiment improved last month after the two sides reached the Phase 1 deal, which is expected to cut tariffs and boost Chinese purchases of U.S. farm, energy and manufactured goods while addressing some disputes over intellectual property. ,Beijing has pledged to buy nearly an additional $80 billion of U.S. manufactured goods over the next two years, plus over $50 billion more in energy supplies, according to a source briefed on the deal. ,But companies remain cautious. U.S. tariffs on $370 billion worth of Chinese imports will remain in place, and memories are fresh of a breakdown in an apparent deal last May which triggered a series of series of tit-for-tat tariff escalations. ,The Phase 1 deal ""stops the bleeding"" but does not end the trade war, a senior U.S. Chamber of Commerce official said on Monday, warning that significant challenges remain. ,Analysts say the risk of further complications and re-escalation remains. ,""Our judgment is Phase 1 will not put an end to Trump Trade Wars,"" analysts with MUFG Bank wrote in a research note prior to the data. ,Moreover, global demand is expected to remain soft this year, offering Chinese exporters only modest relief. ,""The effective tariff reduction from the Phase 1 deal is fairly small, so any bounce in exports may not be terribly exciting..."" ING economists said in a note before the data on Tuesday.    ,""The bottom line (is) China's trade circumstances are still relatively weak, and the tariffs much higher than they were 18 months ago.

"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China's crude oil imports in 2019 surged 9.5% from a year earlier, setting a record for a 17th straight year, as demand growth from new refineries built last year propelled purchases by the world's biggest importer, data showed on Tuesday.  ,Last year, China imported a record 506 million tonnes of crude oil, according to data from the General Administration of Customs. That is equivalent to 10.12 million barrels per day (bpd), according to Reuters' calculations based on the data. ,Chinese crude imports have set records every year since 2003, according to customs data on Refinitiv Eikon.  ,December arrivals were 45.48 million tonnes, customs reported. That is equivalent to 10.71 million bpd, according to Reuters' calculations, the third-highest ever on a daily basis and down from a record of 11.13 million bpd set in November. ,The annual increase equates to 882,000 bpd in incremental purchases, largely because of demand from new plants that added 900,000 bpd to China's oil-processing capacity, although some of the units started operating only in December.  ,December imports were boosted by private refiners using up their annual import quotas, while state plants stocked up on oil before the holiday shutdown that accompanies China's Lunar New Year festival, which falls in late January this year.  ,""Chinese independent refineries, including two mega projects Hengli and Rongsheng, stepped up purchases before year-end to maximize the utilization of crude import quotas,"" said Chen Jiyao, oil consultant at FGE. ,However, state refiners likely slowed down opportunistic purchases amid elevated freight rates in October, resulting in slightly lower December arrivals, said Chen.  ,Last year marked the biggest penetration of private chemical companies into China's refining business, after the emergence between 2016 and 2018 of smaller independent oil processors often known as ""teapots"".  ,Hengli Petrochemical (,) and Zhejiang Petrochemical Corp, controlled by Zhejiang Rongsheng Holdings, each added 400,000 bpd in processing capacity, mainly focused on petrochemical output. That boosted China's crude oil imports notably from Saudi Arabia, helping the kingdom reclaim its title from Russia as China's top crude supplier.  ,Meanwhile, natural gas imports, including fuel supplied as liquefied natural gas (LNG) and via pipeline, were 9.45 million tonnes, the third-highest on record on a monthly basis.   ,The hefty December purchases included LNG imports that rose to a record last month with China overtaking Japan the world's top importer of the fuel for the second month in a row. ,Imports 2019 expanded 6.9% to 96.56 million tonnes, with the annual growth slowing from 31.9% recorded for 2018.  ,China's gas consumption slowed last year as Beijing eased its coal-to-gas switching program amid a slowing economy and growth in domestic gas output.  ,Tuesday's data also showed China's refined fuel exports in 2019 rose 14.1% from a year earlier to a record 66.85 million tonnes as refinery throughput outpaced domestic fuel demand growth. December exports were 6.79 million tonnes. ,China raised the volumes of its first batch of 2020 fuel export quotas by 53% from a year earlier to 27.99 million tonnes.

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - When Mehdi Farsi decided to shift production of State Bicycle Co's niche fixed-gear urban bikes out of China to escape U.S. tariffs, it took months to find another factory in Asia willing to do business with his Arizona company. ,Farsi, who founded the firm in 2009 with his brother and another cycle fanatic, turned to Taiwan but soon found most factories were so swamped with business from rivals that they declined his ""low volume and less profitable"" orders. ,The company's struggle to find a competitive manufacturing alternative to China epitomizes the challenges many U.S. firms have faced since the start of the trade war between the world's two biggest economies 18 months ago. ,A survey by Cowen & Co. at the end of 2019 found only 28% of North American companies had switched supply chains away from China. Of those firms, just a fraction had managed to shift 75% or more of their supply chain to a different country. ,Alternatives often lack the infrastructure and capacity to absorb everyone seeking a new base. That has driven up the costs of moving and sourcing new supply chains to the point where some U.S. firms say it makes more sense just to take the tariff hit. ,A Phase 1 trade deal between Beijing and Washington, expected to be signed on Wednesday, will at least hold off increasing tariffs U.S. President Donald Trump imposed on bicycles from China. But the 25% tariff on bikes and a host of other products will remain in place to give the U.S. leverage in further talks. ,The bike industry is a small part of what experts call the biggest shake-up in cross-border supply chains since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. ,From furniture, electronics, apparel, tires, vacuum cleaners, to name a few, companies are moving operations to Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam and other Asian countries. ,(GRAPHIC-Made in China: U.S. bicycles: ,) ,Farsi's experience with State Bicycle https://www.statebicycle.com echoes the Cowen & Co. findings. After months of research and several trips, a small Taiwanese factory agreed to make his bikes but he had to triple orders and pay 30% of the cost of goods up front, unlike in China where he paid upon delivery. ,The new terms locked up as much as $1 million of working capital until the bikes were shipped and required a new credit line. After a year of toil, State Bicycle managed to shift production of only two of its five models which are sold in the United States. ,""It took a lot of time and resources,"" said Farsi. ,Gina Chang, secretary general of the Taiwan Bicycle Association, likened the Sino-U.S. trade war to a ""Christmas gift"". But she said the island's limited capacity meant some manufacturers had turned down business to focus on existing orders, mainly for e-bikes from Europe. ,Taiwan's U.S. bike exports jumped 37% to 597,000 in the first 10 months of 2019, the association said. But Chang said manufacturers were hesitant about expanding production lines as they feared orders might dwindle if the trade war ended. ,""Trump is fickle ... will the shift of orders continue in 2020?"" she said. ""We need to wait and see.""  ,In a move to help bicycle companies, the Trump administration has been granting tariff exclusions to some of their imports since September. The relief, however, is only for a year and is meant to give them more time to move production - ideally to the United States. ,But Don DiCostanzo, chief executive officer of Pedego Electric Bikes https://www.pedegoelectricbikes.com in California, said higher labor costs and the absence of a viable supply base have made it ""virtually impossible"" to assemble bikes in the United States. ,DiCostanzo examined setting up a U.S. factory but said production costs would have doubled - and exceeded the tariffs. He moved Pedego's production to Vietnam in December 2018 instead. ,""Even if they slap 100% tariffs on bicycles, I'm not sure that will be enough to bring production back to the U.S,"" DiCostanzo said. ,Farsi, meanwhile, said he didn't even consider moving production to the United States and lingering uncertainty about tariffs has left him no option but to stay invested in Taiwan - despite the 12-month relief. ,(GRAPHIC-Rush For Safe Havens: ,) ,In the 1970s, the United States assembled more than 15 million bicycles a year. Now it makes fewer than 500,000, according to industry data presented to the United States Trade Representative (USTR) in 2018. By contrast, China made about 95% of the 17 million bikes sold in 2018, U.S. Census data showed. ,The world's second-largest economy also provides more than 300 million components such as tires, tubes, seats and handlebars - or about 60% of U.S. bike component imports. ,While none of the alternative manufacturing bases can easily supplant China, a rush for safe havens has kept their factories very busy. Taiwan, for example, accounted for 6.3% of U.S. bicycle imports in 2019, up from 3.6% a year earlier, according to U.S. Census bureau data.  ,And with their factories bursting at the seams, Taiwanese suppliers are quoting higher prices.  ,In a September filing with the USTR, bicycle wholesaler J&B Importers Inc , in Florida said some factories in Taiwan were quoting prices that exceeded the cost of the tariffs. ,Farsi said State Bicycle's production costs were higher than in China and the Taiwanese factory was taking four months to fill orders compared with just two in China. ,Pedego Electric Bikes said it didn't have any difficulty finding a factory in Vietnam because it was among the first companies to move there. But it faced other challenges. ,It had to bring in workers from China to train local staff. Batteries had to be sourced from Japan or Korea and tires from Malaysia. ""We had to set up the supply chain,"" DiCostanzo said. ""That was perhaps the most frustrating part."" ,He said factories in Vietnam are so overburdened, suppliers were building new facilities or extending old ones. Industry estimates show factories outside China would need to boost capacity by 13 times to meet U.S. bicycle import demand. ,In a USTR filing, Noble Bikes https://www.noble-bikes.com in Washington state said it had suspended plans to launch new models due to a lack of different manufacturing options. ,""It is very difficult to get out of China,"" said Alex Logemann at U.S. industry association PeopleForBikes https://peopleforbikes.org.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices rose slightly in December even as households paid more for healthcare, and monthly underlying inflation slowed, supporting the Federal Reserve's desire to keep interest rates unchanged at least through this year. ,The weak inflation report from the Labor Department on Tuesday came on the heels of data last week showing a moderation in job growth in December. Economists said these developments were flagging a sharp slowdown in domestic demand. Though the economy appears to have maintained a steady pace of growth in the fourth quarter, it was likely supported by falling imports. ,""This is giving rise to the fear that maybe economic demand is showing early signs of hitting a new soft patch for growth that will carry into the first quarter of 2020,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""The Federal Reserve is on the sidelines this year, but that could swiftly change if overall economic demand weakens and inflation shows little sign of returning to target.""  ,The Labor Department said its consumer price index increased 0.2% last month after climbing 0.3% in November. The monthly increase in the CPI has been slowing since jumping 0.4% in October. In the 12 months through December, the CPI rose 2.3%. That was the largest increase since October 2018 and followed a 2.1% gain year-on-year in November.  ,The CPI accelerated 2.3% in 2019, the largest rise since 2011, after increasing 1.9% in 2018. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI would rise 0.3% in December and advance 2.3% on a year-on-year basis. ,Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI edged up 0.1% after climbing 0.2% in November. The so-called core CPI was up by an unrounded 0.1133% last month compared to 0.2298% in November.  ,Underlying inflation in December was held back by declines in the costs of used cars and trucks, airline tickets and household furnishing and operations, which offset increases in the prices of healthcare, apparel, new motor vehicles, recreation and motor vehicle insurance. ,In the 12 months through December, the core CPI increased 2.3%, the largest gain since October 2018, after rising 2.3% in November.

PCE price data for December will be published later this month. ,The U.S. central bank last month left interest rates steady and signaled monetary policy could remain on hold this year after it reduced borrowing costs three times in 2019.  ,Minutes of the Fed's Dec. 10-11 meeting published early this month showed policymakers generally expected inflation would eventually hit the central bank's target as the economy continued to expand and resource utilization remained high.  ,There were, however, concerns among some officials ""that global or technology-related factors were exerting downward pressure on inflation that could be difficult to overcome."" ,Moderate inflation was underscored by the employment report last Friday, showing the increase in annual wage growth retreating below 3.0% in December, despite the unemployment rate holding at near a 50-year low of 3.5% and a broader measure of labor market slack dropping to a record 6.7%. ,Weak inflation offered no boost to consumers' purchasing power, with average weekly earnings slipping 0.1% last month after edging up 0.1% in November. This could hurt consumer spending, which is already slowing. ,""It is hard for the average household to keep up the spending we have seen if their spending power is going nowhere,"" said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.  ,In December, gasoline prices advanced 2.8% after rising 1.1% in November.

The bank reported credit card, merchant services and auto revenue surged $6.3 billion or 9%, with credit card loans up 8%.  ,But revenues were under pressure this quarter from lower deposit margins because low interest rates meant that the bank earned less on deposits it loaned out. Home lending revenue was also down 5% to $1.3 billion. ,Total loans, excluding home lending, rose 3% in the quarter. Home loans were down 17%. ,Deposits flowed into the consumer bank in the fourth quarter, helping to offset a decline in loans, as Chase opened around 100 new bank branches 2019 in many new cities where it previously had not been located.

There are mounting safety concerns about systems that can perform driving tasks for extended stretches of time with little or no human intervention, but which cannot completely replace human drivers. ,NTSB makes safety recommendations but cannot compel action, while NHTSA can order a recall if it deems a vehicle poses an unreasonable safety risk. ,Last week, NHTSA said it was launching an investigation into the Dec. 29 crash of a Tesla (,) Model 3 that left a passenger dead after the vehicle collided with a parked fire truck in Indiana.  ,That crash is the 14th involving Tesla that NHTSA's special crash investigation program has taken up in which it suspects Autopilot or another advanced driver assistance system was in use.

"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Tesla Inc Chief Executive Elon Musk is coming close to earning the first $346 million tranche of options in a record-breaking pay package, after the electric vehicle maker's stock more than doubled in the last three months.  ,Shares of Tesla surged 9% to a record high on Monday. They need to rise another 6% to put Tesla's stock market value at $100 billion and then be sustained at that level for both a one-month and six-month average in order to trigger the vesting of the first of 12 tranches of options granted to Musk to buy Tesla stock.  ,Musk has already hit an operational target that is also necessary for the options to vest. ,For Musk's subsequent tranches to vest under the terms of the 2018 package, the company's market cap would have to continue to sustainably rise by $50 billion increments over the agreement's 10-year period, with the billionaire earning the full package if Tesla's market capitalization reaches $650 billion and the electric car maker achieves several revenue and profit targets. ,A full payoff for Musk, who is also the majority owner and CEO of the SpaceX rocket maker, would surpass anything previously granted to U.S. executives, according Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisor that recommended investors reject the pay package deal at the time.  ,Musk receives no salary or cash bonus, only options that vest based on Tesla's market cap and milestones for growth. ,""This is the very definition of pay for performance,"" said Ian Keas, senior director at Longnecker & Associates, an executive compensation consulting firm.

"LONDON/BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock (,) Chief Executive Larry Fink warned company boards to step up efforts to tackle climate change, a  significant shift by the world's top asset manager as it faces mounting concerns about its fossil fuel investments. ,In his annual letter to CEOs posted on the company's website on Tuesday, Fink forecast a ""fundamental reshaping of finance"" and said companies must act or face anger from investors over how unsustainable business practices might curb their future wealth. ,Fink also said BlackRock would ""be increasingly disposed"" to cast critical proxy votes tied to sustainability, and said in a separate letter to clients that the firm will by mid-2020 sell off from its actively managed client portfolios stakes in companies that derive more than 25% of their revenues from thermal coal production. ,Climate activists hailed Fink's revamped stances and said they would put pressure on rivals, though some cautioned the New York-based asset manager must still back up its new rhetoric. ,""As the biggest financial institution in the world, BlackRock's announcement today is a major step in the right direction and a testament to the power of public pressure calling for climate action,"" said Ben Cushing of the U.S.-based environmental group Sierra Club, in an emailed statement.  ,A shift in global investing trends has sent trillions of dollars into passive funds run by BlackRock and rivals Vanguard Group and State Street Corp, (,) bringing all three powerful new leverage on top corporations. ,A Vanguard spokeswoman said the firm aims to address climate change ""while adhering to our obligations to deliver long-term value to our fund holders."" State Street did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ,All three companies count clients with a wide range of political views and tried to represent their actions in terms of investment strategy rather than politics. ,Montana Senate Majority Leader Fred Thomas, a Republican and legislative liaison with the Montana Board of Investments, for which BlackRock manages assets, said he supports the use of many fuel sources including coal and that BlackRock should be wary of calls to move away from fossil fuels. ,""Any effort in my opinion to try to placate this environmental agenda just to get along and go along is a bad decision for any business,"" Thomas said. , A Reuters analysis in October found the top index fund managers rarely challenge company management and have largely opposed climate change proposals. In 2018 and 2019 BlackRock and Vanguard only backed around 10% of climate-related shareholder resolutions.  ,Historically BlackRock has said it lobbies corporate executives behind the scenes, an approach that critics said undercuts other reform efforts. ,At Exxon Mobil's (,) annual meeting on May 29, for instance,  BlackRock backed all but one of 10 directors up for election and opposed all but one of seven shareholder proposals, disclosures show.  ,Fink on Tuesday said BlackRock would disclose its proxy votes quarterly and give more explanation about high-profile decisions.  ,In an interview, Robert Jackson, a member of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said he was ""thrilled"" with the step as a way to create more accountability for the votes. ,Investors have begun to put their money into more climate-friendly funds, albeit the overall size of the action is still small. New deposits into sustainable funds grew to $20 billion in 2019, according to data from Morningstar, nearly four times the previous year's record. ,BlackRock has promised more focus on climate issues in the past but disappointed activists. The company did not make Fink or other executives available to comment.  ,In an interview with CNBC Fink said, ""More and more clients are looking for a more sustainable portfolio"" and reiterated that companies should make more disclosures like those promoted by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board.     ,BlackRock did not give specific details on which companies it might divest or the size of those positions, and Fink wrote  BlackRock will ""continue to hold exposure to the hydrocarbon economy.""

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He prepare to sign a ""Phase 1"" trade deal, new data show that the costs of Trump's trade wars are proving more widespread, deeper and longer-lasting than previously believed. ,Research from the U.S. Federal Reserve and other top economists shows that U.S. tariffs on Chinese industrial components and materials, which largely won't be lifted by the deal, are proving especially damaging to American manufacturing competitiveness and jobs.      ,The White House has scheduled a signing ceremony on Wednesday for what Trump is touting as ""the greatest and biggest"" trade deal ever made, with China expected to pledge to boost purchases of American exports by $200 billion over two years, including $80 billion more in manufactured goods, $32 billion more in farm products and $50 billion more in energy.  ,China also has promised to open its financial services market, improve protections for intellectual property and forbid the forced transfer of technology to Chinese companies. But Beijing has a history of pledging reforms that don't happen, and many consider the purchase targets unrealistic. ,The deal caps years of U.S. tensions with China that boiled over into a trade war 18 months ago, as Trump slapped new duties on $370 billion worth of goods from China. Beijing hit back with retaliatory tariffs on over $100 billion worth of U.S. exports.  ,The trade war's most immediate effect has been a drag on global economic output. The World Bank last week marked down its global growth forecasts , for 2020 and 2021 because of a slower-than-expected recovery in trade. ,Early predictions that Trump's tariffs could spark a U.S. recession have proven unfounded, in part because of the consumer-driven nature of the American economy. The Trump administration's 2017 tax cut package and three Fed interest rate cuts in 2019 also helped stimulate activity.  ,The U.S. tariffs on China targeted industrial goods, components, semiconductors and machinery. Major tariffs on consumer goods such as cellphones, laptop computers and toys were scheduled to go into effect last month, but the Phase 1 deal suspended them indefinitely.  ,Trade wars were a key factor in a broad slowdown of U.S. manufacturing activity last year. U.S. manufacturing output fell in seven of 11 months, with an annualized 3.3% drop in the second quarter, the largest since the second quarter of 2009, when the economy was in recession, according to data compiled by the U.S. central bank. ,Aluminum, electric lighting, furniture, semiconductors and steel mills saw the most benefit from tariff protections, while companies that stamp, forge and otherwise process steel and aluminum into components and end-products suffered the most from higher input costs.  ,U.S. companies have paid $46 billion in tariffs since Trump, who has adopted an ""America First"" trade policy to revitalize the manufacturing sector, started restructuring relationships with Washington's major trading partners. ,Tariffs that will remain on goods from China after the Phase 1 trade deal are a big problem for the U.S. economy going forward, said Mary Lovely, a trade economist at Syracuse University in New York state. ,""You're taxing things that our businesses need to be competitive, and yet you're saying the point of this is to support manufacturing,"" Lovely said of Trump's tariff actions. ""But it does seem very clear now that the data is pointing in that direction, that these (tariffs) are having a negative effect on manufacturing."" ,A new Fed paper , released on Dec. 23 analyzes the effect of all new tariffs imposed in 2018 and 2019, including global steel and aluminum duties, on the industries that are most exposed to the tariffs and those that benefit the most from them. It estimates that the tariffs caused more manufacturing job losses than were gained during those years. ,""For manufacturing employment, a small boost from the import protection effects of tariffs is more than offset by larger drags from the effects of rising input costs and retaliatory tariffs,"" Fed researchers Aaron Flaaen and Justin Pierce wrote. ,U.S. tariffs on bicycles and components from China have prompted Arnold Kamler, chairman and chief executive officer of Kent International, an importer of Chinese-made bicycles sold at Walmart Inc and other big retailers, to lay off nearly 50 employees and shelve plans to start building bikes at home. ,Trump's tariffs on steel and other goods from China have cost the firm many millions of dollars, Kamler told Reuters, adding that these are not addressed in the Phase 1 deal.  ,As 2019 drew to a close, freight rail traffic, a key leading indicator of manufacturing, slowed dramatically. Total car loadings recently hit a record low, and were down by more than 30% from last year's levels for the weeks beginning Dec. 30 and Jan. 6, according to the American Association of Railroads. ,(GRAPHIC: Freight rail traffic has plunged in the trade war - ,) ,The less-volatile three-month average of the annual change is off by nearly 10%, a freight rail slowdown surpassed just one other time since the last financial crisis - during the 2015-2016 shale oil bust. ,The manufacturing recession has been accompanied by a slowdown in U.S. goods exports, which have fallen 1% from 2018 levels due in part to retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods. ,Another study , released last week by researchers from the Fed, the U.S. Census Bureau and the University of Michigan found that manufacturing firms paying the tariffs saw a bigger drop in exports, demonstrating that import duties play a role in exports. ,Higher supply chain costs have cut exports by about 2% for  products greatly exposed to tariffs on inputs, compared to exporters with no such exposure. ,The study also found that Trump's tariffs are affecting a wide swath of U.S. companies, with nearly a third now paying them on some 46.5% of their purchases. ,These firms employ 32% of all private, non-farm employees in the country. Companies are trying to move supply chains out of China to avoid the tariffs, but this has proven costly, according to a poll taken by Cowen and Co. Doing so ""can be complicated, expensive and disruptive to the business,"" the company's analysts said. ,The deal being signed on Wednesday suspends Trump's plans to levy tariffs in December on $156 billion in Chinese consumer goods, including cellphones, laptop computers and toys. It also halves the tariff rate to 7.5% on a $120 billion list of Chinese imports, from Bluetooth headphones and flat panel televisions to footwear. ,But it leaves in place 25% tariffs on a $250 billion list of Chinese machinery and industrial components, including auto parts, semiconductors, printed circuit boards, furniture and lighting products. ,Even if Trump's remaining China tariffs go away in the coming months with a ""Phase 2"" agreement, U.S. exports may not recover.  ,American firms hit with Mexican and Canadian tariffs that ended last year are finding the market for their products doesn't open back up after the trade war ends, noted Daniel Anthony, vice president of The Trade Partnership, a consultancy that recently crunched the data from the U.S. Commerce Department.  ,(See chart of exports hit with retaliatory tariffs here , ,Mexico and Canada put retaliatory tariffs on more than $15 billion worth of U.S. goods, including bourbon whiskey, ketchup and apples after Trump slapped duties on their steel and aluminum exports. ,Buyers of these U.S. goods may have found new suppliers overseas or at home, decided they didn't need the product, or found demand for their product dried up, Anthony said.       ,As Trump prepares to sign the long-awaited deal with China, economists are likely to question whether the outcome was worth the cost. ,""Was the hammer that was used really worth what we got out of it?

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday threw out a lower court ruling that allowed a lawsuit to proceed against managers of a  retirement fund for IBM Corp employees centering on allegations that officials failed to disclose that IBM's microelectronics business was over-valued. ,The justices sent the case back to the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for a further legal analysis. IBM is not a defendant in the lawsuit filed in New York federal court by plaintiffs who were participants in IBM's retirement plan. ,IBM welcomed the ruling, company spokesman Douglas Shelton said. ,""This case has important implications for businesses' ability to offer strong employee stock ownership plans and for employees, across all industries, to invest in their companies,"" Shelton said in a statement. ,Participants in IBM's retirement plan have said that in 2013 the company's microelectronics division was incurring losses even though IBM said at the time it was valued at $2 billion. ,The plaintiffs said the Retirement Plans Committee of IBM, which oversaw the fund, knew or should have known that the business was over-valued and made disclosures to lower the risk of an artificially high stock price and a painful correction once the problems in the unit were made public. The committee's members included senior IBM executives. ,IBM sold the microelectronics business a year later at a significant loss, prompting a decline in the company's stock price. IBM paid GlobalFoundries Inc $1.5 billion to take over the money-losing unit and announced it would take a $2.4 billion write-down on the entire value of assets as well as $800 million of other unspecified costs.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government is nearing publication of a rule that would vastly expand its powers to block shipments of foreign-made goods to China's Huawei, as it seeks to squeeze the blacklisted telecoms company, two sources said. ,The U.S. Commerce Department in May placed Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL] on a trade blacklist, citing national security concerns. That allowed the U.S. government to restrict sales of U.S.-made goods to the company and a small number of items made abroad that contain U.S. technology. ,Under current regulations, key foreign supply chains remain beyond the reach of U.S. authorities, fueling frustration among China hawks within the administration and a push to expand U.S. authority to block more shipments to Huawei.  ,But U.S. businesses say an effort to enable the government to regulate more sales to Huawei to include low-tech items made overseas with very little U.S. technology could end up needlessly hurting U.S. companies while encouraging Huawei to source more goods abroad.   ,Reuters reported in November that Commerce was considering broadening the De minimis Rule, which dictates how much U.S. content in a foreign-made product gives the U.S. government authority to regulate an export.  ,Under current regulations, the United States can require a license or block the export of many high-tech products shipped to China from other countries if U.S.-made components make up more than 25% of the value. ,According to two people familiar with the matter, Commerce has drafted a rule that would lower the threshold only on exports to Huawei to 10% and expand the purview to include non-technical goods like consumer electronics including non-sensitive chips.   ,According to one of the people, the Commerce Department sent the rule to the Office of Management and Budget, following an interagency meeting last week. ,If other government agencies sign off on the measure, the rule could be issued in a matter of weeks as a so-called final rule, with no opportunity for public comment before it goes into effect, the people said.   ,Commerce has also drafted a regulation that would expand the so-called Foreign Direct Product Rule, which subjects foreign-made goods that are based on U.S. technology or software to U.S. oversight. This would be broadened to include low-tech items made abroad that are based on U.S. technology and shipped to Huawei, the people said.  ,In December, Huawei, the world's largest smartphone maker, reported an 18 percent jump in revenue for 2019 and a 20 percent increase in shipments of smartphones.

The signing occurs a week before the U.S. Senate is due to begin its impeachment trial of the U.S. president. ,Trump became only the third U.S. president to be impeached when the House last month approved charges that he abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to announce an investigation into Democratic presidential rival Joe Biden and obstructed Congress. ,Concerns about the trade deal weighed on U.S. stocks on Tuesday, sending shares lower after a Bloomberg report suggested U.S. tariffs could remain in place until after the November presidential election. ,New data showed that the costs of Trump's trade wars were proving more widespread, deeper and longer-lasting , to American manufacturing competitiveness and jobs than previously believed. ,Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said earlier there was no agreement in place with China on further tariff reductions. ,In a joint statement, they said all aspects of the Phase 1 trade deal with China would be made public on Wednesday, except a confidential annex that will detail U.S. products and services to be purchased by China. ,""There are no other oral or written agreements between the United States and China on these matters, and there is no agreement for future reduction in tariffs. Any rumors to the contrary are categorically false,"" they said. ,After the Phase 1 deal was reached last month, Washington agreed to suspend tariffs on $160 billion in Chinese-made cellphones, laptop computers and other goods that were due to take effect on Dec. 15, and to halve existing tariffs on $120 billion of other goods to 7.5%.

"BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Commodity traders and analysts are struggling to map out how China will reach the eye-popping amounts it is committing to buy from the United States under Phase 1 of their trade deal. ,China has pledged to buy $50 billion more in U.S. energy supplies, and will raise U.S. agriculture purchases by some $32 billion over two years above 2017's $24 billion baseline, according to a source briefed on the deal to be signed on Wednesday. The deal also stipulates purchases of an additional $80 billion in manufactured goods. ,Those totals would certainly trim the roughly $300 billion annual trade gap between the countries. However, analysts who study Chinese commodity flows remain skeptical that Beijing can absorb such quantities of U.S. goods without threatening trade ties with other suppliers, hurting its own domestic producers, and making substantial changes to import standards and quotas.  ,""Either China massively increases imports and reduces current account surplus from the current 1.5% of GDP, or it engages in trade diversion away from current providers of goods which compete with the U.S."" said Alicia Garcia Herrero, Chief Economist Asia Pacific at Natixis in Hong Kong. ""I see this second scenario as much more likely."" ,China will have to include U.S. crude, liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments and imports of petrochemical raw materials such as ethane and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to meet the target, Chinese trade sources and analysts said. ,But it would still struggle unless new supply deals are signed that displace other exporters, they said. ,The $50 billion target is ""too aggressive and unlikely to achieve"", said Seng Yick Tee, an analyst at SIA Energy in Beijing, adding that energy product exports from the United States to China were about $8 billion in 2017 and 2018. ,""To achieve $25 billion a year, all the imports need to be tripled."" ,Gavin Thompson, Vice Chair for Asia Pacific at Wood Mackenzie, was surprised by the energy figure since it would mean tariffs on U.S. crude and LNG imports would have to be removed, particularly for LNG to be competitive. ,Quality, rather than quantity, may be another hurdle. ,""Most of the Chinese refineries were designed to process medium-sour crude, but U.S. oil is mostly light, sweet,"" SIA's Tee said, referring to the density and the sulfur amounts in crude, which dictate the types of fuels that can be refined from an oil. ,The pledge to boost U.S. farm imports by over $30 billion over two years is ""shocking"" since that increment is more than the value of farm products it has purchased from the U.S. in a single year, said a China-based grains trader. ,""It would make (more) sense if the $32 billion is the total number, not the increased number."" ,Such a large fixed dollar-figure from one producer would also risk supply disruptions and distort international crop prices, said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING in Hong Kong. ,""Prices of agri (commodities) from the rest of the world could be cheaper, especially after China cut import tariffs (in January).

"MONTREAL/KUALA LUMPUR/PARIS (Reuters) - Why was the Ukrainian airliner mistakenly shot down near Tehran by Iranian forces last week for the loss of 176 lives even allowed to take off from a country that had just fired missiles towards its neighbour? And why didn't the airline just delay or cancel the flight? ,In short - because a century of international air travel has yielded no international agreement on how or when to close airspace; and because airlines often have to rely on their own, sometimes incomplete, assessments to make the call for themselves. ,While air travel is global, and guided by streams of instantaneous electronic data, control over each country's airspace remains entirely local and subject to the pace of politics. ,Iran itself suffered a similar tragedy in 1988 when the U.S. warship Vincennes downed an IranAir passenger jet in 1988. ,Ukraine, too, has been acutely aware of the problem since 2014, when Malaysia Airlines MH17 was shot down over territory held by pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine as it flew from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. ,MH17 led the United Nations' aviation arm, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), to launch a conflict zone website where countries could share information on potential risks around the world so that airlines could avoid those regions. Despite the deaths of 298 people, it foundered after some countries saw a threat to their sovereignty and wanted a 72-hour window to respond, rendering it ineffective. ,Those sensitivities are not new. Few countries trust others to declare their airspace off limits, especially knowing that such decisions can themselves be a product of conflict. ,In 1985, Iraq declared Iran off-limits to civil aviation. But Iraq and Iran were then at war, and the move sparked fierce debate at the ICAO.  ,In 2015, the Netherlands, home to two-thirds of the passengers on MH17, tried at least to have the ICAO spell out criteria for when airspace should be closed.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China has pledged to buy almost $80 billion of additional manufactured goods from the United States over the next two years as part of a trade war truce, according to a source, though some U.S. trade experts call it an unrealistic target. ,Under the Phase 1 trade deal to be signed on Wednesday in Washington, China would also buy over $50 billion more in energy supplies and boost purchases of U.S. services by about $35 billion over the same period, the source, who was briefed on the deal, told Reuters late on Monday. ,The agreement also calls for Chinese purchases of U.S. agricultural goods to increase by some $32 billion over two years, or roughly $16 billion a year, said the source. ,When combined with the $24 billion U.S. agricultural export baseline in 2017, the total gets close to the $40 billion annual goal touted earlier by U.S. President Donald Trump. ,In total, China pledged to buy $200 billion more in U.S. goods and services over the next two years, while Washington suspended some tariffs that had been due to go into effect and halved others. U.S. duties remain in effect on $360 billion of Chinese imports, about two thirds of the total. ,The trade deal does not include an agreement for a future reduction in tariffs on Chinese goods, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement Tuesday afternoon, refuting a Bloomberg news report.  ,""There's no side agreements. The only way the president will be reducing the tariffs is if there is a Phase 2 part of the agreement that is also fully enforceable,"" Mnuchin told Fox Business Network in a subsequent interview. ,Mnuchin said the deal terms would be announced Wednesday, when Trump and Chinese Vice Premier Liu He are slated to sign the agreement at an 11:30 a.m. EST ceremony at the White House, marking a truce after 18 months of tit-for-tat tariffs that have weighed on global growth. ,The ceremony comes just as the U.S. Senate prepares to begin its impeachment trial of Trump, only the third U.S. president ever impeached. ,China's alleged commitments represent a staggering increase over 2017 imports of U.S. goods and services of $186 billion, raising questions about how realistic they are. ,The Chinese translation of the agreement was still under way on Monday, but Mnuchin told Fox Business Network the documents would be released on Wednesday. ""Tomorrow we'll be releasing the documents and people will be able to see there's a very detailed dispute resolution process,"" he said. ,U.S. stocks hit intra-day record highs on Tuesday before turning negative on the Bloomberg report, which said the United States would likely maintain the tariffs until after November's presidential election. ,U.S. companies have paid $46 billion in tariffs since February 2018. ,Mnuchin called the deal a ""great win"" for U.S. companies and farmers and said they stood to gain even more if a Phase 2 deal was reached. He said it would be a ""giant week"" for Trump given the U.S.-China trade deal signing and expected passage of a new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal by the U.S. Senate. ,Despite the truce in the U.S.-China trade war, Lighthizer and his counterparts from Japan and the European Union on Tuesday said they remained concerned about Chinese subsidies that they say are distorting the worldwide economy. ,Beijing's subsidies to state-owned firms are expected to be addressed under the Phase 2 U.S.-China trade deal, but it remains unclear when those negotiations will begin.  ,Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer warned Trump in a letter that failing to hammer out a comprehensive agreement that addressed what he called China's ""rapacious trade behaviors"" would harm U.S. workers and companies for years to come. ,He told reporters that China was the real winner in the trade deal, saying there was ""no real certainty"" that Beijing would buy more U.S. soybeans since it had signed long-term contracts to buy soybeans from Argentina and Brazil.  ,Two other sources familiar with the Phase 1 trade deal confirmed the rough breakdown of energy and manufacturing  purchases, without providing specific numbers. ,The $32 billion agriculture increase over 2017 was confirmed by Myron Brilliant, a senior U.S. Chamber of Commerce official, who spoke to reporters on Monday in Beijing.  ,Analysts and traders doubt whether China could absorb such a big increase in commodity purchases, and said relying so heavily on U.S. goods raised concerns about price and supply risks. ,Trump has heralded the expected Chinese farm purchases, keen to support a major Republican political constituency that has been battered by Chinese retaliatory tariffs. ,The boost in manufactured goods includes significant purchases of autos, auto parts, aircraft, agricultural machinery, medical devices and semiconductors, said one of the sources, without naming any specific suppliers. ,The aircraft would likely be built by Boeing Co (,), the No. 1 U.S. exporter, whose new sales to China have ground to a halt over the past two years. ,One of the sources who expressed skepticism about the manufacturing target noted the U.S.-China trade deal does not address non-tariff barriers that have kept these U.S. goods out of the Chinese market for decades, such as procurement rules, product standards and subsidies to Chinese state-owned firms. ,Chinese car sales have been flagging and excess domestic assembly capacity rising, making purchases of significantly more U.S.-built cars unlikely. Among the most popular U.S.-built vehicles sold in China are BMW (,) and Mercedes-Benz (,) sport-utility vehicles.   ,Many economists and experts are dubious about enforcement of the Phase 1 agreement. ,The deal allows Washington to reinstate tariffs on Chinese goods if it cannot resolve a claim of Chinese non-compliance, but nothing would preclude China from retaliating, people familiar with the deal said. ,Oil traders and analysts were also doubtful whether China would be able to purchase an extra $50 billion of energy products, including crude oil, liquefied natural gas and imports of petrochemical raw materials such as ethane and liquefied petroleum gas.

"(Reuters) - A rapid rise in the price of gold since 2000 has driven millions of people to deposits in Africa, South America and elsewhere where they dig for gold using basic technology. ,Such informal digging – known as artisanal or small-scale mining (ASM) - has been around for centuries, and gold offers cash to communities that may lack alternatives. There are now around 15-20 million artisanal miners, and millions more depend on them, Delve, a global platform for ASM data, estimates. ,More and more people are trying to bring this fast-growing trade into the formal economy. But it has generated toxic waste and fed labor abuses, organized crime and prostitution, according to groups including the United Nations and the OECD. ,Artisanal and small-scale miners often operate ""freelance,"" sometimes paying landowners to access a site, or handing bosses a share of their ore. ,Many work with little more than pickaxes and shovels and carry what they dig on their backs. Others use diggers and crushers. ,Often, miners use mercury to extract the gold, then turn it into semi-pure nuggets of dore (pronounced door-ray) to sell to traders. ,Consumption of gold has risen, as rapid economic growth in China created millions of new gold buyers and the economic crisis of 2008 drove investors into assets - like bullion - expected to hold their value.  ,That pushed prices from less than $300 an ounce in 2000 to around $1,500 now XAU=, making mining more attractive than farming for many in countries with often rapidly growing populations. ,It is hard to measure the output of artisanal and small-scale miners but Metals Focus, a consultancy, estimates they now produce about 560 tonnes of gold a year worth some $27 billion. Mechanised mines produce around 2,900 tonnes a year, it says. ,It can leak toxins and pollute water systems.  ,Informal mines often collapse. Children often work on sites, sometimes forced by unscrupulous bosses to squeeze into narrow pits. ,Such mining feeds a shadow economy that deprives states of taxes: Gold worth billions of dollars is smuggled from Africa every year.  ,Narcotics dealers and warlords use the gold to launder profits or buy arms. ,Consumers in the West increasingly want products that are ethically sourced, so many large banks, jewelers and gold refineries are wary of artisanal gold. Typically they only buy from carefully monitored schemes that ensure miners are treated fairly and the source of gold is traceable. ,But the amounts produced this way are small. ,Much of the rest goes to buyers under less scrutiny, in places such as the Middle East and India, according to trade data and people in the industry. The gold can enter the global system from there. ",Business News,1/15/2020 9:19,What is artisanal gold and why is it booming?
"ENTEBBE (Reuters) - In a refinery just outside Uganda's main airport, workers slip bars of freshly refined gold into clear plastic bags sealed with a sticker of the national flag - black, yellow and red - and the label ""Ugandan's Treasure.""  ,Uganda produces little gold of its own. Alain Goetz, who set up the refinery, says that by branding gold from abroad as Ugandan, the operation is merely imitating others - for example, the Swiss don't mine the gold they refine in Switzerland.  ,A pink building guarded by dogs at Entebbe on the shores of Lake Victoria, the refinery, African Gold Refinery (AGR), is part of a trend across Africa. Small-scale mining is booming, and new gold refineries are opening by the dozen, to process metal produced by informal diggers in Africa and beyond. ,The refineries, which often win high-level political backing, can be positive because they offer miners and states a way to extract value from their own mineral wealth rather than just exporting raw commodities. But if not properly controlled, they risk adding to problems of smuggling and funding conflict.  ,Some of Africa's new gold refineries are in South Africa, a major gold producer with an already large refining industry. There, authorities granted 19 refining licenses in the year to March 2019 - as many as in the previous three years combined. ,Elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa - where until 2012 there were only a handful of refineries - as many as 26 are now either operating or under construction across 14 countries from Mali to Tanzania, including in states which mine little gold at home, a Reuters survey of public reports found. Officials in at least three more countries including Madagascar and Ivory Coast have publicly said they are interested in hosting a refinery. ,Governments of gold-producing countries in Africa have long complained that the precious metal in their rocks is being illegally produced and smuggled out on a vast scale, sometimes by criminal operations, often at a high human and environmental cost.  ,By refining gold - in some cases obliging producers and traders to sell their gold to home-grown refineries - states hope to capture value that is being lost. Some new refineries have invested in systems to ensure they process gold from legal and environmentally responsible miners. ,""The only way to stop (smuggling) is having multiple refineries in Africa,"" said Frank Mugyenyi, head of the minerals unit at the African Union.  ,But because informal miners already often operate through smuggling networks to avoid tax and scrutiny, officials and industry sources say some refineries risk inevitably joining these shadowy channels.  ,With so many refineries competing for gold to process, each has scant incentive to check where its gold comes from. ,Just 13 of them – those for which Reuters was able to obtain data – state they can handle more than 1,400 tonnes of gold a year, worth around $70 billion. That means they could treat around twice Africa's estimated total gold production, and nearly a third of the world's supply.  ,Of 22 refineries surveyed by Reuters, 14 did not respond to requests for more information about the size and nature of their business.  ,Two responses to the survey showed a lax approach: One small operator, Bupe Chipando who heads Alinani Precious Metals Ltd in Kenya, said he does not yet purify gold, but just melts blocks of impure metal together and ships them overseas. Officials said they knew of at least two other African refiners who did the same thing. ,Another, Robert Baker, the CEO of Bekora Miners in Cameroon, said most of the gold his refinery processed was not declared to customs, in order to avoid paying tax on metal it exports. Cameroon's government did not respond to requests for comment.  ,The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has developed global sourcing standards against which it recommends refineries are audited. Outside South Africa, no African refineries have yet followed that recommendation, said Louis Marechal, an OECD expert on responsible business conduct at who has traveled widely in Africa consulting with governments and companies on how to regulate and source gold responsibly.   ,The new refineries offer an important outlet for millions of individuals who dig for gold using basic technology.  ,Industrial mining companies usually fly metal they produce in Africa to large refineries accredited by the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), the industry's standard setter. All but one of these are outside the continent. Concerned about the risks of rights abuses, crime or conflict in the supply chain, LBMA-accredited refineries typically steer clear of metal from informal miners. ,Six of Africa's new refineries - in Cameroon, Kenya, Mali, Rwanda and Uganda - shared output data with Reuters. With combined annual capacity for around 270 tonnes, they currently process around 41 tonnes of gold a year worth some $2 billion. For comparison, refineries in Switzerland handle around 2,500 tonnes of gold a year, worth $120 billion at current prices. ,Some people in the industry concede that it is hard for Africa's new refiners to be accepted as mainstream suppliers. Large banks, jewelers and electronics makers generally only accept gold from refineries accredited by groups such as the LBMA. LBMA rules require a refinery to operate for at least five years and process large amounts of gold before it can be accredited.  ,Neil Harby, chief technical officer at the LBMA, said several refineries in countries including Ghana are partnering with LBMA-accredited refineries, which support their efforts to control sources and offer an outlet to the global market by re-refining the gold they produce. ,This helps to improve miners' livelihoods by lifting them out of the shadow market, he said. But it is time-consuming and expensive, and requires close regulation, such as a requirement that gold is exported via a refinery. ,In Uganda, AGR has already established itself as a major player. It said it exported more than 17 tonnes of gold worth around $800 million in 2019; it is listed in the supply chains of more than 200 U.S. companies' regulatory filings for 2018.  ,It is surrounded by a manicured lawn and palm trees. Inside, men in fireproof masks and aprons process metal through mills, furnaces and cooling drums. ,Founder Goetz, a Belgian whose family has traded gold for two decades in Africa's Great Lakes Region, said he set up the refinery in response to informal approaches by unidentified government officials in the region in 2014. They saw ""a need to make the supply chain more professional, more transparent by setting up a refinery,"" he said. ,In a landscape where new refiners compete for metal to treat, AGR has taken risks with the sourcing of its metal. Last year, it processed gold from Venezuela, where the state-run gold industry has been sanctioned by the United States since 2018 to try to prevent the government from using it to earn hard currency. ,Ugandan authorities said in March they were investigating AGR's Venezuelan gold imports worth $300 million on grounds it may have been smuggled.  ,The Attorney General dismissed those allegations but the same month, U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary Marshall Billingslea traveled to Uganda to ask authorities about the fact AGR accepted gold from Venezuela, a U.S. official said. Investigators have returned twice since, the official added.  ,AGR says all the Venezuelan gold it refined was declared to the relevant Ugandan authorities, who declined to comment further. ,Uganda has long been a conduit for gold worth billions of dollars mined in neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo. The trade fueled regional wars, funded rebel fighters and led to United Nations sanctions on traders involved, to try to staunch the flow.  ,Uganda's official gold exports grew to $116 million in 2006/7, according to central bank data. Then sanctions were imposed and official exports collapsed, averaging under $17 million a year until 2014/15, the data show. ,Once Uganda's refineries started up, the country's official exports rose again. Since AGR launched in 2016, they have jumped to $1.1 billion for 2018/19 - nearly triple the country's earnings from coffee.  ,Congo's own official exports of informally mined gold remained negligible, which Congolese officials say shows much of its metal is being smuggled out.  ,AGR was one of four refineries to which Uganda's tax authority wrote in September. The letter, seen by Reuters, complained of ""rampant cases of fraud in the gold trade business including forgery and misrepresentation of customs documents, stamps and signatures."" It did not specify details, and the tax authority declined to elaborate.  ,AGR says its raw gold comes mainly from the region, but is not smuggled. ""We have turned down a considerable number of individuals and companies who did not have the relevant documentations and whose source of gold is from (places) considered as high risks or sanctions areas,"" an AGR spokesperson said. ,Goetz said he recently stepped down as CEO of the refinery to spend time on charitable work, sold his shares to an unidentified investor from the Gulf, and now acts as a consultant to the refinery. Asked who ultimately owns AGR, neither Goetz nor the refinery's spokesperson would comment. ,Africa's new refiners operate amid networks of buyers who are willing to pay extra for gold. These include smugglers taking advantage of tax differentials between African states, or looking to slip gold out of the continent. ,Smugglers typically sell gold abroad for hard currency such as dollars, which they can use to purchase goods including cars, electronics or local currency that are in high demand in Africa. These they sell.  ,By not paying tax and avoiding the banking system, they can pay above market price for the gold and pocket the profit they make on the resale of the goods.  ,One refinery in Mali says it is struggling to compete with smugglers. Kankou Moussa Refinery has been in operation since 2015 and says it plans to invest more than 400 million euros  ($445 million) to create a network of centers which will buy gold and educate miners on how to work safely. ,But smugglers and money-launderers pay up to three percent above market price for gold, said Dario Littera, its president. ,""They are losing ... on the gold, but they are paid in hard currency that they take back and buy local currency for a profit,"" he said.  ,With high profits from smuggling and weak oversight pushing vast quantities of gold into the informal economy, there is little incentive for the new refineries to play by the rules, said the OECD's Marechal.  ,He said he had seen at least one case when individuals implicated in large scale gold-smuggling in one West African country set up a refinery in another.  ,Without better and more consistent regulation, he said, competition between the new refineries may degenerate into a ""race to the bottom.

"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Carlos and Carole Ghosn, the former first couple of carmaker Nissan, are united again in Beirut. They hold hands in the street and whisper together in a mix of Arabic and French. They kiss. ,But the pair's most visceral display of unity comes when they talk about Carlos Ghosn's former home. ,""I'm done with Japan,"" said Carole Ghosn in an interview with her husband in a private house in Beirut. ,Two weeks ago, Carlos Ghosn made a dramatic escape from house arrest in Japan, where he was awaiting trial on charges of under-reporting earnings, breach of trust and misappropriation of company funds. He denies all charges. ,Shortly after Ghosn appeared in Beirut, Japanese authorities issued an arrest warrant for Carole on suspicion of alleged perjury related to the misappropriation charge against her husband. ,""What they're accusing me of is a bit of a joke,"" said the 54-year-old Lebanese-American national, who spent many years as a fashion designer in New York and whose children live in the U.S. city.  ,""I testified for hours and they told me you are free to go, and now, nine months later... this comes up. They are vindictive. This has nothing to do with the law."" ,Carlos Ghosn was even more adamant. ""I spent 18 years in Japan; I never suspected this brutality, this lack of fairness, this lack of empathy."" ,Tokyo prosecutors have said his allegations of a conspiracy are false and that he has failed to justify his acts. ,The plan to flee to his childhood home of Lebanon developed quickly with a small group of people, a ""reasonable price"" and utter secrecy, he said. ,""The first rule if you want to do something like is that no member of your family should be aware because they become very anxious,"" he added. ,Asked whether she would have dissuaded him to escape, Carole Ghosn blurted: ""Yes!"" ,But then she paused, looked at her husband and added: ""No. I mean, actually, let me rephrase. If you told me this at the beginning, I would have said No, of course not. You're going to fight this and prove your innocence... But then, with time, we saw how the prosecutors were behaving... I said 'Oh my God my husband is never going to get a fair trial' and I was desperate."" ,""I'm happy he did it,"" she said. ,Japan's justice minister has said Ghosn's escape from his trial could constitute a crime. ,Beirut has no extradition agreement with Japan and Ghosn's legal team is pushing for him to stand trial in Lebanon. But Ghosn said last week that he does not want his own case to hurt relations between Lebanon, which is currently in the throes of an economic crisis, and the world's third-largest economy.  ,The Ghosns have been attempting to focus the narrative on the question of human rights — and what they say is the inhumane way that Ghosn was treated after his arrest in late 2018. Ghosn says he was held in isolation, given only limited access to his lawyers and – his biggest complaint – prevented from speaking to his wife. The couple had been married for two years — second unions for both — when Ghosn was first arrested. He says they spoke for only two hours in nine months. ,""They wanted to break me, they wanted to put me into a situation where life was miserable,"" he said. ,Japan's Justice Minister Masako Mori has called the accusations ""absolutely intolerable."" ,During his arrest, Carole Ghosn said she sought the support of Human Rights Watch, hired a high-profile human rights lawyer in Paris, and appealed directly to President Donald Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron to help her husband's case.  ,Carlos Ghosn said he was determined up until late last year to stay in Japan and see through the investigation and his trial. On Christmas Day, he said, he realized the legal cases could last five years and decided to bolt.  ,The Ghosns said their life in Beirut consists of working with their legal team and spending evenings with friends. ,Both have their regrets - including, for Carole Ghosn, throwing a lavish party at the 17th century palace in Versailles, France, for her 50th birthday. The party has become part of a separate investigation in France to establish if the venue was obtained improperly by the Ghosns (which both deny), and has also prompted criticism of the couple as leading an extravagant lifestyle.  ,""It was a beautiful event, and now it has turned out to be a big disaster,"" said Carole Ghosn. ""Now, I look at it, it's unfortunate - I wish we never did it."" ,Both said they would be happy to stay in Lebanon, for the rest of their lives, if that was necessary. ,As for returning to Japan? ,""Never,"" said Carole.

"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn, speaking in Beirut after his dramatic escape from Japanese justice, said on Tuesday that the French ambassador had warned him shortly after his arrest that his own company was plotting against him. ,""Frankly, I was shocked by the arrest and the first thing I asked is make sure Nissan knows so they can send me a lawyer,""  Ghosn told Reuters in an interview in Beirut.  ,""And the second day, 24 hours from this, I received a visit from the French ambassador who told me: 'Nissan is turning against you'. And this is where I realized that the whole thing was a plot."" ,Former Nissan CEO Hiroto Saikawa, who was forced to resign last year after admitting that he had received improper compensation, told a news conference hours after Ghosn's arrest that Ghosn had been using corporate money for personal purposes and under-reporting his income for years. ,The arrest of Ghosn, widely respected for rescuing the carmaker from near-bankruptcy, has put Japan's criminal justice system under international scrutiny. ,The French Embassy in Tokyo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ,Nissan reiterated a previous comment, including that the car maker ""discovered numerous acts of misconduct by Ghosn through a robust, thorough internal investigation.

"DUBAI (Reuters) - Over the past three years, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) has expanded its oil and gas business and quietly raised more than $19 billion in a variety of ways. See main story: ,BlackRock (,), the world's largest fund manager, and other major financial institutions have invested in the company. ADNOC has also sold a stake in its pipeline infrastructure and refining businesses, listed its fuel distribution division and offered international oil companies long-term concession deals. ,Below are some of the key deals the state oil company has announced since 2018, part of Abu Dhabi's plans to reform and modernize the economy and ADNOC, the emirate's crown jewel. ,In 2019, U.S. investment firms BlackRock and KKR signed an agreement to invest $4 billion in ADNOC's midstream pipeline  assets for a 40% stake in the business, ADNOC Oil Pipelines. ,Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC will invest $600 million in the crude pipeline infrastructure for a 6% stake.  ,In 2019, Italy's Eni (,) and Austria's OMV (,) agreed to pay a combined $5.8 billion to take a stake in ADNOC's refining business and establish a new trading operation owned by the three partners. The deal, which expands ADNOC's access to European markets, furthers Eni's diversification away from Africa and gives OMV a downstream oil business outside Europe. ,Under the agreement, Eni and OMV will respectively acquire a 20% and 15% share in ADNOC Refining, with ADNOC owning the remaining 65%.  ,IN 2017, ADNOC raised 3.1 billion dirhams ($851 million)through an initial public offering of its fuel distribution unit on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange. ADNOC Distribution sold 1.25 billion shares, or 10% of its share capital.  ,ADNOC signed a series of 40-year agreements with international energy companies for concessions. ,France's Total (,) was awarded a 20% stake in the Umm Shaif and Nasr concession and a 5% interest in the Lower Zakum concession.

"Dubai (Reuters) - The talk's all been about Saudi Aramco, and the suspense of its historic drive to whip up international cash. But, more quietly, its Gulf oil peer ADNOC has also been courting foreign funds - and its efforts compare favorably. ,Like Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi's economy was hit by a dramatic  fall in oil prices in mid-2014, triggering a drive to reduce its dependence on crude. A central part of that has been to reform and modernize state champion ADNOC and attract foreign investment. ,Unlike Aramco's push for a giant stock market listing, which has been highly publicized and closely watched, ADNOC has gone for a more staggered approach with its fundraising efforts, and there has been little overview of their scope by industry experts. ,However the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company, to give its full name, has raised more than $19 billion over the past three years from overseas investors, according to Reuters calculations based on publicly released size of investments, signing fees and share sales.  ,That's equivalent to two-thirds of the $29.4 billion that Saudi Aramco raised in the biggest initial public offering (IPO) in history. Despite the record-breaking December listing, the bulk of the shares were sold to domestic investors after foreign institutions baulked at the valuation.  ,ADNOC, which supplies nearly 3% of global oil demand, has for example struck deals with the world's largest fund manager BlackRock (,) and with U.S. investment firm KKR, a rare foray for both into national oil companies in the Middle East. ,It has also sold stakes in its pipeline infrastructure and refining businesses. ,While both Gulf state-controlled firms are aiming to replicate the model of oil majors by expanding in downstream, trading and petrochemicals, their funding strategies diverge, said Dmitry Marinchenko, analyst with Fitch rating agency. ,""Aramco is raising funds mainly by conventional borrowing while ADNOC is using more sophisticated forms of funding, including selling minority stakes in subsidiaries,"" he said. ""ADNOC is more open to cooperation with international partners."" ,It remains to be seen which approach to attracting investment will prove more fruitful in coming years. But at stake could be the companies' ability to successfully diversify from crude production and, more broadly, for the domestic economies that rely on them to weather oil price shocks. ,""The biggest challenge is the uncertainty in the outlook for oil and the growing international scrutiny that all energy companies are facing because of climate change,"" said Helima Croft, managing director of RBC Capital Markets.  ,The reforms have been driven by Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed, de-facto ruler of the wider United Arab Emirates. Their roots can be traced back to 2016, when oil prices fell to $30 a barrel, hitting state revenues and exposing how sensitive Abu Dhabi finances were to volatile prices.  ,The crown prince, known as MbZ, appointed ally Sultan al-Jaber as CEO of ADNOC with a plan to restructure the company to make it more efficient and function more like a major than a state monopoly. ,Al-Jaber swiftly embarked on plans to reshuffle ADNOC's leadership and slashed 5,000 jobs, mainly foreigners, out of its 60,000 employees.  ,It is no easy task to change the course of an organization viewed as one of the most conservative in the region, however. ADNOC's production depended on decades-old concessions with Western oil majors, some of which have been operating in the UAE since the 1930s, and new deals and foreign investment were uncommon. ,In April 2016, two months after installing al-Jaber, MbZ made a rare visit to ADNOC's headquarters to deliver a wake-up call to managers and staff. ,His message, demanding a sharp change in a culture of entitlement, was unexpected in a nation where most citizens expect guaranteed state jobs with long-term security. ,He told ADNOC employees they should feel no sense of entitlement, and that the UAE cannot be chained to oil price fluctuations anymore, whether at $30 or $100 a barrel, said Haif Zamzam, vice president of transformation and business supply at ADNOC who was present during the crown prince's visit.  ,""He said 'You show me your CV and you show me your experience, you show me what you are able to actually do, and you have great opportunities,"" said Zamzam, who had worked with al-Jaber at state investor Mubadala. ,The visit sent a message to ADNOC's old guard that he would not brook any opposition, said people familiar with the company. ,""People used to come to ADNOC to clock in and clock out and leave at 2pm, and they expect their children to also work there. That is not the case anymore,"" said one UAE-based industry source. ,Al-Jaber, a minister of state and a former CEO at Mubadala's energy unit who holds a PhD in business and economics, was tasked with making ADNOC profitable enough to contribute to the UAE's budget even with lower oil prices.  ,""We wanted to challenge the conventional business model of the National Oil Company,"" he told Reuters in an interview at his office on the 63rd floor of ADNOC's skyscraper HQ.  ,""To make it simple - we are in the business of stretching the dollar from every barrel we produce."" ,ADNOC does not publish financial results but, nonetheless, investors appear to like the changes.  ,KKR's investment in 2019, its first as a direct investment in the region, was due to ADNOC's reforms, a spokesman for the U.S. firm said. ,ADNOC has formed new partnerships with European and Asian energy firms such as Italy's Eni (,) and China's CNPC to boost its oil, gas and trading businesses, and was the first foreign company with a deal to store oil in India's strategic reserves. ,In his drive to emulate oil majors, al-Jaber has lured employees from Total (,), Royal Dutch Shell (,) and BP (,) to launch new trading operations. He has also led a change in the way ADNOC plans to change the way it prices its oil by establishing a new crude benchmark. ,The pace of the reforms has surprised industry players. ,""He transformed the company,"" said Claudio Descalzi, CEO of Eni, one of ADNOC's newest partners. ,Al-Jaber stressed the reforms were ongoing. ,ADNOC plans to invest $45 billion to expand its refining and petrochemicals operations with partners and is looking to boost its international market share for crude and fuel, he said. ,""We don't want only to stick to the known or the traditional partners,"" said the CEO. ""We don't want to leave any stone unturned."" ",Business News,1/15/2020 10:38,"As Aramco hails record IPO, Abu Dhabi's ADNOC whips up $19 billion"

If that growth materialises it would be 30% stronger than in 2019. ,It raised its forecast for non-OPEC oil supply growth in 2020 by 0.18 million bpd to 2.35 million bpd, up from 1.86 million bpd in 2019. ,""The continued accommodative monetary policies, coupled with an improvement in financial markets, could provide further support to ongoing increases in non-OPEC supply,"" OPEC said. ,OPEC and some non-OPEC allies such as Russia have been curbing production to prevent an oil glut and support oil prices above $60 per barrel.

"(Reuters) - Bank of America Corp got stung by lower interest rates in the fourth quarter, sending its profit down 4%, a trend that management expects to continue this year. ,The Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender is especially vulnerable to rate movements because of the composition of its balance sheet.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Willie Walsh, who created British Airways parent IAG (,) by dragging old-fashioned flag carriers into the modern age of budget flying, will step down in March to be replaced by Iberia boss Luis Gallego. ,Walsh, who had announced in November that he intended to retire in the next two years, will be succeeded by the man credited with turning round IAG-owned Iberia since on March 26, IAG said on Thursday.  ,The appointment of Gallego, CEO of Iberia since 2014, meant there would be little change of direction at IAG, analysts said. But the Spaniard will face intense scrutiny as he takes over from one of the most high-profile figures in British industry over the past 20 years. ,Irishman Walsh, a dealmaker who made his name standing up to unions and cutting costs, was BA chief executive before overseeing its merger with Iberia in 2011. That deal created an airline group that has since outperformed rivals Air France (,) and Lufthansa (,) while seeking to compete with budget disrupters Ryanair (,) and easyJet (,). ,IAG chairman Antonio Vazquez said that Gallego, 51, is the right candidate to replace the retiring Walsh, 58, and lead IAG in the next stage of its development. ,Richard Buxton, of IAG shareholder Merian Global Investors, said Walsh's departure represented the end of an era. ,""But as they say, all good things must come to an end. I know his successor is a good egg, otherwise the board would not have appointed him,"" Buxton said.  ,Market reaction was positive, with IAG shares gaining 1.9% to 630 pence by 1432 GMT. ,As CEO of Iberia, Gallego cut the airline's losses by half in his first year in charge and in his second year restored profitability after six years of operating losses. ,""Luis has successfully turned Iberia around in his years in charge and has much experience of the Willie Walsh/IAG approach,"" said Jonathan Wober, analyst at the CAPA-Centre for Aviation research company. ,Gallego faces a number of challenges in his new role, not least the ""flygskam"", or ""flight shame"", movement that has shone a spotlight on aviation emissions and encourages people not to fly. ,More specifically, IAG last year scaled back its three-year capacity growth plans, citing the competitive environment, and it has also been contending with reputational damage from pilot strikes at BA, which accounts for over half of group profit. ,Merian Global's Buxton said he would like the new CEO to do more to improve labour relations between staff and management, adding that the top-15 investor is counting on the new IAG leadership to do more to knit its brands together.  ,Walsh, a former pilot, took on the unions and slashed costs first at Ireland's Aer Lingus, where he became CEO in 2001, and then at British Airways, earning him the nickname Slasher Walsh in an industry he once characterised as a ""fight for survival"". ,It was at Aer Lingus where he formed the template for his strategy, benefiting from a front-row seat to the rapid expansion of budget rival Ryanair (,).  ,Walsh was much quicker than Air France-KLM and Lufthansa to embrace budget flying. IAG bought short-haul carrier Vueling in 2015 and set up long-haul, low-cost carrier Level in 2017. ,Those strategies have helped to fuel success at IAG, shares of which are up 140% since 2011. Lufthansa shares, meanwhile, has remained flat over the period and Air France stock has declined by 29%.  ,Walsh also bought Aer Lingus in 2015 and IAG is in the process of a 1 billion euro ($1.1 billion) deal to buy Spain's Air Europa. ,IAG said that Walsh would step down from his role and the board of IAG on March 26 before retiring on June 30, leaving Spanish executives dominant at the top of the Anglo-Spanish group.

"(Reuters) - The diverging fundamentals of U.S. oil and natural gas can be seen dramatically in the markets, where the oil-to-gas price ratio has surged to its highest in six years. ,The oil-to-gas ratio, or the level at which oil trades compared with natural gas, recently reached 30-to-1, and could increase further as analysts expect average gas prices will fall for a second consecutive year in 2020 to their lowest level in over 20 years.  ,That is because most U.S. drillers are not looking for gas.  ,Companies like EOG Resources Inc (,), Pioneer Natural Resources Co (,), Diamondback Energy Inc (,) and Exxon Mobil Corp (,) are mostly seeking more valuable oil and natural gas liquids, which bring with it a lot of associated gas, making producers less sensitive to gas price declines. ,""By-product natural gas, which doesn't adhere to the laws of supply and demand, accounts for nearly half of U.S. gas production,"" S&P Global Ratings said in a report lowering its gas price assumptions for 2020-2022. ,U.S. oil futures CLc1 this week hit their highest level since April, while gas NGc1 was near its lowest since August, boosting the oil-to-gas ratio to 30-to-1, highest since September 2013.  ,(GRAPHIC: U.S. oil-gas ratio ,)  ,Over the last five years, that ratio has averaged 19-to-1, but oil prices have risen in the last year while gas has edged lower.

"TOKYO/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Japanese prosecutors on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant for Carlos Ghosn's wife for alleged perjury, as officials stepped up efforts to bring the fugitive car industry boss back to face trial on financial misconduct charges. ,The former Nissan Motor, and Renault chairman fled to Lebanon last month from Japan, where he has alleged there was a government-backed coup to oust him. ,A senior Japanese Ministry of Justice official said staff were poring over Lebanese laws to find a way to bring back Ghosn and that Japan ""will do whatever it can"" to put him on trial. ,In Beirut, the justice minister confirmed that prosecutors had received a ""red notice"" arrest warrant from Interpol in respect of Ghosn and would take the necessary action.  ,The ministry said nothing had been received from Japanese prosecutors relating to an arrest warrant for his wife, Carole, who is in the Lebanese capital. ,The Japanese warrant accuses her of falsely claiming not to know, or to have met, people connected to a company that received payments from Nissan Motor, part of which it subsequently transferred to a firm owned by Ghosn.     ,Japan's ambassador to Lebanon, Takeshi Okubo, met President Michel Aoun on Tuesday to request ""greater co-operation on this in order to avoid negative repercussions for our friendly relations"", according to Aoun's office. ,Ghosn is scheduled to hold a news conference on Wednesday, his first such appearance since his arrest in November 2018 and his dramatic flight to Lebanon, his childhood home..     ,""Last time Carlos Ghosn announced a press conference and got re-arrested.

"(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (,) unveiled details about its consumer business for the first time on Tuesday and will start disclosing its results regularly as part of a broader reporting-line shuffle, responding to long-standing requests for more transparency from analysts and investors.    The changes are part of Chief Executive Officer David Solomon's efforts to get Goldman in line with rivals like JPMorgan Chase & Co (,) and Citigroup (,) that have bigger consumer businesses and share more information with investors. ,Goldman's consumer business, which includes Marcus and the bank's credit card, generated $822 million in revenue over the four quarters ended Sept. 30, representing 2.4% of the bank's total revenue during the period. ,Since Goldman launched the online retail bank in 2016, analysts have repeatedly asked for more details about its credit quality and growth on earnings calls.  ,Some have also sounded alarms about potential risks, worried that Goldman might be expanding into consumer lending ahead of a recession, with little experience in the business. ,Executives have typically said they are duly cautious about credit quality, and that the consumer business was not yet big enough to warrant routine disclosures. ,Goldman set aside $302 million for potential consumer credit losses in the first nine months of 2019, compared with $338 million for 2018 and $123 million in 2017, according to its 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ,As the business grows, the Wall Street bank will naturally have to boost credit provisions. Goldman reported $5.5 billion worth of consumer loans as of Sept. 30, up 22% from year-end. ,Goldman unveiled Marcus as part of a broader strategy that initially planned to generate $5 billion in fresh annual revenue by entering new businesses and growing existing ones.  ,The bank had little choice but to change, due to huge declines in trading, which was once its main profit engine. Goldman has since backed off the revenue goal, intending to replace it with other metrics at its investor day later this month, Reuters reported in November. (,) ,Its new consumer reporting line will include details about not only Marcus, but also wealth management — another area the bank is trying to expand. Goldman already has a sizable private bank that caters to the ultra-rich, but wants to start offering more services to individuals with fewer assets as well. (,) ,Over the four quarters ended Sept. 30, Goldman generated $5.1 billion in revenue from that segment, $822 million, or 16%, of which came from the consumer portion. The broader segment generated $540 million in pretax profit, representing less than 5% of total earnings. ,The other major change Goldman announced in a filing, which was sent out late on Monday but was made public on Tuesday, is its decision to get rid of a reporting-line segment called ""Investing & Lending,"" which detailed revenue from those activities across various businesses.  ,Goldman created that segment as part of another reporting-line shuffle in 2009. It aimed to clarify what the bank earned from activities with its own balance sheet, after a sweeping financial-regulatory law banned proprietary trading. ,But investors and analysts have complained that the reporting line was a volatile black-box, and discounted its importance to Goldman's overall profitability. Revenue from that line will now be distributed across different segments. (,) ,Goldman will now have four reporting lines: Investment Banking, Global Markets, Asset Management and Consumer & Wealth Management. Previously its results were segmented into Investment Banking, Institutional Client Services, Investing & Lending and Investment Management. The trading business, which was previously housed in Institutional Client Services, will now be part of Global Markets.  ,Some analysts applauded the changes. ,""The new reporting structure appears more centered around its different client segments and should help drive increased accountability in how it executes on its relatively new strategy,"" Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg said. ,Goldman is expected to unveil the new targets and metrics at its first-ever investor day on Jan. 29. It is expected to report fourth-quarter results on Jan. 15. ,The investment bank's shares were up nearly 1.2% in morning trade.  ,(This story corrects time period to four quarters in paragraph 3 and 12)       ",Business News,1/7/2020 11:42,Goldman Sachs answers investor demands on consumer bank

Statscan revised the October deficit to C$1.61 billion from an initial C$1.08 billion. ,The figures are the latest in a string of unimpressive recent data that analysts say are likely to point to fourth-quarter annualized economic growth coming in below the 1.3% that the Bank of Canada had forecast in October. ,The value of goods exports fell 1.4% in November, with seven of the 11 product categories posting declines, while imports fell by 2.4% to C$49.78 billion.

Industry figures show about half of Canada's exports move by rail. ,Peter Hall, chief economist at Export Development Canada, said the dip in exports was also tied to global trade worries stemming from a dispute between China and the United States. ,""As long as this investment hesitation we're seeing around the world ... persists, we're going see weakness inside of these numbers,"" he said in a phone interview. ,The Bank of Canada has held its overnight interest rate steady for more than a year even as several of its counterparts, including the U.S. Federal Reserve, have eased rates. ,The central bank is due to release updated forecasts on Jan 22, which is also the date of its next fixed rate announcement.

"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean restaurant owners expressed concern on Monday over food delivery giant Delivery Hero's (,) proposed $4 billion acquisition of its local rival, saying the move could undermine competition and lead to higher fees.     ,Delivery Hero, the second-largest food delivery app operator in South Korea, said last month that it agreed to buy larger rival Woowa Brothers backed by Goldman Sachs in a deal subject to antitrust approval. ,The combination of the two giants would create an entity with a combined market share of nearly 99% in food delivery apps, according to data from mobile big data platform IGAWorks. ,Restaurant owners, already struggling with the slowing economy, raised concerns that the dominant player would raise commissions that it charges restaurant owners for taking orders via their apps.  ,""The biggest problem is that the companies can move the market to whatever direction they want to,"" said Kim Kyung-moo, who runs a franchise restaurant, said at a news conference at the parliament.  ,Restaurant owners, food delivery riders and lawmakers urged the fair trade commission to thoroughly review the potential merger, which they said could also limit consumer choices. ,A spokesman at Woowa Brother told Reuters that the firm is not planning on increasing commission fees.​​​​​​  ,South Korea, with a dense population and high smartphone use, is the world's fourth biggest market for online food orders, with an annual value of $5.9 billion.  ,Berlin-bgased Delivery Hero last week submitted an application to the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) for an approval, an official at the antitrust regulator said, declining to comment further as a review is in progress. ,In 2009, the watchdog approved U.S. online commerce firm eBay Inc's (,) deal to acquire local rival Gmarket in South Korea on the conditions that there would be a ban on raising sales commissions for the next three years.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street's worst fears of a year-end funding squeeze never materialized thanks in large part to the quarter-trillion dollars the Federal Reserve stuffed into the market to ensure nothing became gummed up.  ,The question now, though, is what it will take for the U.S. central bank to withdraw from its daily liquidity operations in the $2.2 trillion market for repurchase agreements, or repos - after it became a dominant player in a short three months.  ,""The repo operations are a band-aid, but the wound isn't healed fully,"" said Gennadiy Goldberg, an interest rate strategist at TD Securities.         ,The New York Fed began injecting billions of dollars of liquidity into the repo market in mid-September, when a confluence of events sent the cost of overnight loans as high as 10%, more than four times the Fed's rate at the time. A month later, the Fed moved to expand its balance sheet - and boost the level of reserves - by snapping up $60 billion a month in U.S. Treasury bills.  ,The Fed will continue pumping tens of billions a day into the repo market through at least the end of January. Its ability to exit from the repo market after that time will depend on how long it takes the central bank to make the balance sheet large enough so there are adequate reserves in the banking system - and the repo operations are no longer needed.  ,""It seems implausible to me that the Fed will be able to stop their repo operations by the end of January,"" said Mark Cabana, head of U.S. rates strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  ,Minutes from the Fed's December policy meeting released on Friday showed its staffers expected repo operations to be ""gradually"" reduced after mid-January. However, staff members also said the central bank may need to continue offering some repo operations until at least April, when tax payments could reduce the level of reserves.  ,Another challenge for Fed officials: Deciding just how big the central bank's balance sheet, which is currently about $4 trillion, should be.  ,""There are people at the Fed who have a preference for the smallest possible balance sheet, and we just don't know how much their views have evolved,"" said Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, a research firm.  ,Fed policymakers have said they will continue purchasing Treasury bills into the second quarter of 2020 with the goal of bringing reserves back above the level seen in mid-September, when they fell below $1.5 trillion.  ,Bringing reserves to $1.7 trillion would provide a cushion of about $200 billion to absorb shocks during periods of tight liquidity, said Joseph Abate, a short rate strategist for Barclays. Holding up to $2 trillion in reserves could offer a bigger cushion and reduce the likelihood of volatility in short-term borrowing markets, depending on what the demand is for reserves, he said. ,'LONG-TERM CONVERSATIONS'    ,Some financial firms are urging the Fed to stay involved permanently through a standing repo facility, which would allow firms to trade Treasury holdings for cash. But Fed officials are still working out the details and plan to keep discussing the issue at future meetings, the minutes from Friday showed.  ,Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said on Friday that in addition to a standing repo facility, long-term fixes for providing more liquidity in money markets could include adjusting liquidity regulations and setting restrictions on other programs that can affect reserves, such as the foreign repo pool.  ,""All those are legitimate long-term conversations to have now that we're through the short term,"" Barkin told reporters after a speech to the Maryland Bankers Association in Baltimore.  ,In the meantime, Fed officials could make changes to the repo offerings to help wean markets off the temporary support. Officials could reduce the frequency or the size of the repo offerings after January and bring them back during times of expected stress, Abate said.  ,One issue is that the Fed is allowing dealers to borrow cash at a cheaper rate than is available from other market participants, which discourages firms from borrowing in the private market they used before the Fed began to intervene, Goldberg said.  ,Figuring out the right structure could take some time. ""What they want to do is incentivize the market to go to fellow market participants first and the Fed second, and I don't think we're there yet,"" Goldberg said.

"SEOUL (Reuters) - With Samsung Electronics (,) expected to suffer its biggest annual profit drop in at least a decade, investors are counting on an expected uptick in the memory-chip market to cure the tech giant's ills this year. ,When it issues preliminary fourth-quarter results on Jan. 8, the world's top maker of memory chips used in smartphones, laptops and servers is set to post a 40% slump in operating profit to 6.48 trillion won ($5.56 billion), according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate, weighted towards more consistently accurate analysts.  ,The three months ended December are expected to mark the South Korean firm's fifth year-on-year decline in quarterly profit, ending a year marred by bloated stockpiles of chips that squeezed prices, and the U.S.-China trade war that roiled global supply chains and prospects for consumer demand. ,With 2018 having been a record year for earnings, last year's slump likely means Samsung posted its biggest percentage drop in annual profit in at least a decade.  ,But with the United States suspending planned December tariffs on Chinese goods, including mobile phones and laptops, concerns about demand have eased as optimism for the rollout of new 5G networks around the world has grown. ,""We expect overall market recovery in the first quarter of 2020,"" said Michael Yang, a director at IHS Markit. ""Both solid demand forecast from the server/hyperscale (infrastructure) customers and optimism around 5G smartphone adoption are the drivers for growth."" ,Reflecting that mood, analysts polled by Refinitiv SmartEstimate expect Samsung's annual profit to surge nearly 40% in 2020. The company itself doesn't typically issue full-year earnings estimates. ,Despite 2019's tough times for the world of chips, Samsung still generated half of its January-September profit from the business. That core strength, along with optimism for 2020, helped Samsung's shares ride out weak earnings to end last year  with a 44% gain, compared with an 8% rise for the Seoul benchmark index.  ,Still, many industry experts remain cautious about the strength of recovery this year. ,""The chip market will rebound in 2020 from a low base last year, but it is premature to expect a boom (like that) seen in 2017,"" said Park Jun-hong, a director at S&P Global Ratings. ,Samsung, also the world's leading maker of mobile phones, TVs and displays, itself echoes that caution.

"WASHINGTON/AMSTERDAM/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The Trump administration mounted an extensive campaign to block the sale of Dutch chip manufacturing technology to China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo lobbying the Netherlands government and White House officials sharing a classified intelligence report with the country's Prime Minister, people familiar with the effort told Reuters.  ,The high-level push, which has not previously been reported, demonstrates the importance the White House places on preventing China from getting hold of a machine required to make the world's fastest microprocessors. It also shows the challenges facing the U.S. government's largely unilateral efforts to stem the flow of advanced technology to China.   ,The U.S. campaign began in 2018, after the Dutch government gave semiconductor equipment company ASML, the global leader in a critical chip-making process known as lithography, a license to sell its most advanced machine to a Chinese customer, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. ,Over the following months, U.S officials examined whether they could block the sale outright and held at least four rounds of talks with Dutch officials, three sources told Reuters.  ,The effort culminated in the White House on July 18 when Deputy National Security Advisor Charles Kupperman raised the issue with Dutch officials during the visit of Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte, who was given an intelligence report on the potential repercussions of China acquiring ASML's technology, according to a former U.S. government official familiar with the matter. ,The pressure appears to have worked. Shortly after the White House visit, the Dutch government decided not to renew ASML's export license, and the $150 million machine has not been shipped. ,Ilse van Oevering, a spokeswoman for Rutte's office, declined comment, saying the government cannot discuss individual licensing cases.  ,The White House declined to comment. Kupperman did not reply to a request for comment.  ,The delayed shipment was first reported on Nov. 6 by the Nikkei Asian Review, but details of the U.S. pressure campaign have not previously been disclosed. ASML said it is still awaiting approval of a new license request and declined further comment. ,ASML has never publicly disclosed the identity of the Chinese customer, but Nikkei and others have reported that it is Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), China's biggest chip-making specialist. SMIC did not reply to a request for a comment.  ,The ASML machine uses extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light beams, generated by lasers and focused by giant mirrors, to lay out extraordinarily narrow circuits on slabs of silicon known as wafers. That in turn makes it possible to create faster and more powerful microprocessors, memory chips and other advanced components, which are critical for consumer electronics and military applications alike. ,Only a few companies, including America's Intel Corp, South Korea's Samsung Electronics and Taiwan's TSMC, are currently capable of manufacturing the most sophisticated chips. But China has made catching up to those companies in chip-making technology a key national priority and is investing tens of billions of dollars in the effort. ,That drive has run head-on into the Trump administration's efforts to block the flow of sensitive technology to China on national security grounds. Companies selling U.S.-made goods are now barred from shipping them to blacklisted Chinese firms including telecoms giant Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] and surveillance vendor Hikvision without a special license. ,The U.S. government can also deny licenses to firms that want to sell goods made with U.S. technology to any Chinese company, not just those on the export blacklist. But blocking companies like ASML that manufacture overseas is much more difficult.  ,Under current regulations, the U.S. can require a license for many high-tech products shipped to China from other countries if U.S.-made components make up more than 25% of the value. The U.S. Department of Commerce conducted an audit of ASML's EUV machine, two sources told Reuters, but found it did not meet the 25% threshold, according to one of the people. ,The U.S. Department of Commerce is now considering lowering the 25% threshold in some cases, Reuters reported in November.     ,With no way to block the sale directly, the Trump administration pressed its Dutch ally to consider the security issues. Lithography equipment falls under the purview of an international agreement known as the Wassenaar Arrangement, which coordinates export restrictions of so-called 'dual-use' technology that has commercial and military applications. ,U.S. Department of Defense officials met their Dutch counterparts several times to discuss the security risks of the sale, two sources told Reuters. Meetings took place at the Netherlands embassy in Washington in late 2018 and January 2019, two separate sources said.  ,Pompeo urged Rutte himself to block the sale, despite commercial pressures to let ASML proceed, during a visit to the Netherlands last June, three sources said.  ,With a market value of more than 110 billion euros, ASML has grown to dominate the lithography market over the last two decades and is the pride of Dutch industry. ,""Our ask is that our allies and our partners and friends don't do anything that would endanger our shared security interest,"" Pompeo told reporters in The Hague on June 3. He did not mention chip equipment specifically. ,The U.S. Department of State did not reply to a request for comment.  ,Six weeks later, during his visit to the White House, Rutte was given a copy of the intelligence report. Reuters could not determine whether U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned the ASML deal to Rutte during the White House meeting. ,ASML's export license expired unused on June 30, 2019, and no new license was granted in the following eight-week period during which a renewal request would normally be considered, according to a public database of licenses published by the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs. ,    Netherlands Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Irene Gerritsen said the Dutch government has sovereign discretion to grant licenses of dual-use technology and would not comment on specific cases. ,With or without the EUV license, ASML expects its Chinese sales to increase in 2020 as it continues to ship earlier-generation equipment.

"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - ""We're going to help you understand your missed opportunities,"" the boss of delivery app Rappi tells restaurants and food brands. ""Why Wednesday is maybe not the best day for you, or why lunch is better than dinner."" ,Sebastian Mejia's pitch might seem bold for a delivery firm but it helps explain why Rappi is spending heavily on a lightning expansion across Latin America. It is quietly building up the firepower of its secret weapon: data.  ,The company, whose couriers' orange backpacks have become familiar features of cities like São Paulo, Bogota and Mexico City, has yet to make a cent of profit after five years.     ,However, three executives told Reuters that, behind the scenes, Rappi was gathering shopper and sales data that is coveted by consumer brands ranging from food group Nestle (,) to beermaker Anheuser-Busch InBev (,), as well as restaurants, supermarkets and stores. ,The company's rapid expansion could be a high-risk strategy, though, and relies on keeping cash flowing from investors until profits materialize.  ,""Part of the vision of Rappi is to build an ecosystem,"" 35-year-old co-founder Mejia told Reuters in an interview. ""It's much more than a delivery company.""     ,The startup, which is valued at an estimated $3.5 billion and backed by Japan's SoftBank (,), has swept across nine countries since 2015. It delivers everything from groceries and restaurant food to medication and furniture, and has branched out into scooter rental, travel and basic banking services.  ,Every transaction generates data about shoppers such as where they live, what they want and when they need it. Rappi is looking to lure more and more people to the app, a move that would further enrich its data. ,Rappi does not hand over individual customer data to its merchants but instead looks at shopping trends, Mejia said.   ,The firm next plans to push into more cities across Latin America that have at least 500,000 people, while working on adding more digital banking services, added Mejia, who is from Colombia. The startup has yet to expand deeply into Central America. ,Gabriel Simões, tech research analyst at Itaú BBA in São Paulo, said the jury was out on Rappi's plan to launch a swathe of services at once in its bid to quickly gain users, rather than focusing on just one core offering, like bringing you lunch. ,""They're trying to try to lock more users into their platform,"" he added. ""It could play out well. But it's very early in the game to make sure this is the best strategy or not."" ,It's not going to be easy; Rappi faces stiff competition in Latin American deliveries from global players Uber and Didi Chuxing, as well as a host of local apps like iFood and Cornershop, all trying to eat each other's lunch.  ,Rappi has an average of more than 10 million active users monthly, according to research firm Apptopia, and says it provides deliveries for almost 100,000 businesses. ,Some industry experts raised concerns about the startup's high cash burn and need for fresh funding to maintain its growth. They said Rappi may find it difficult to wean users off the big discounts and promotions it is offering to win them over, which can hinder profitability. ,A lunchtime delivery of soup, tacos and a burrito in Mexico City may cost 319 pesos ($16.80), for example, but can end up at just 40 pesos after factoring in offers. Rappi also sends coupons via text, offering deals like 30% off alcohol between 5 and 11 p.m. ,Some merchants, meanwhile, said they were reluctant to rely too heavily on Rappi in case the startup failed and that they were looking at developing their own delivery apps.  ,SoftBank invested close to $1 billion in Rappi last April, making the app its biggest bet in Latin America. There is pressure on the Japanese investor to make Rappi a success following steep losses at two of its other big investments, WeWork and Uber. ,SoftBank declined to comment on Rappi's strategy. ,Rappi's data can help consumer brands as well as the restaurants and grocery stores that sell directly on the platform, according to Luis Techera, head of strategic partnerships for the app in Mexico.  ,If Gillette, for example, wants to launch a new razor, it can have Rappi send 100,000 samples to people aged between 27 and 35 years old who live in certain neighborhoods.  ,""Rappi can deliver them in a week to all the users who already bought a Gillette razor, and that's an attack that nobody has,"" Techera said.  ,Nestle credited Rappi's data for allowing it to analyze shopping habits, from groceries and pharmacies to restaurants.  ,""Rappi has no choice but to keep growing. We see Rappi as a vehicle that will keep helping the development of e-commerce for groceries,"" said Luis Macin, Nestle's vice president of e-commerce in Mexico. ,Asked how soon Rappi would turn a profit, Mejia said his priority was to grow fast, and that investors were on board with the plan.  ,""I want to get to as many consumers as possible,"" he said. ""I'd rather invest in that than focus on short-term goals or short-term profitability.""  ,Hendrick Lee, managing partner of Palm Drive Capital which has invested in Rappi, said the startup's spending made sense in its quest to attract the masses.  ,""I understand why Rappi is burning large amounts of money to get there,"" he added.         ,($1 = 18.9700 Mexican pesos) ",Technology News,1/6/2020 12:06,"Data's the secret weapon for Rappi, SoftBank's big bet in Latin America"
"LONDON (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard suffered ""buyer's remorse"" over its disastrous $11 billion acquisition of Autonomy and was trying to pin the blame on UK entrepreneur Mike Lynch, London's High Court heard on Monday in the closing stages of a multi-billion dollar case. ,U.S. software giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) is suing Autonomy founder Lynch along with his former finance chief Sushovan Hussain for more than $5 billion, alleging that they inflated the value of the British data firm before selling it.  ,Lynch and Hussain have denied the allegations.  ,HP bought Autonomy in 2011 but a year later it wrote down the value of the British company by $8.8 billion, saying it had uncovered serious accounting improprieties. ,Lynch's lawyer Robert Miles told the court on Monday that HP's then-chairman Ray Lane had ""serious cold feet"" almost immediately after the deal was announced, and the company's board and management had never seriously tried to integrate Autonomy.  ,""This is a case study in buyer's remorse,"" he said.      ,""The board buckled to the pressure of the adverse movement in the share price and indeed we say lost their corporate nerve,"" he added.  ,HP has argued Lynch and Hussain were complicit in a plan to inflate the value of Autonomy through a series of fraudulent transactions, such as selling hardware at a loss and ""round-trip"" deals, a type of barter with no real commercial rationale.    ,The U.S. company, in its closing argument last month, said Lynch had invented evidence on the stand in order to distance himself from some of the alleged fraudulent transactions. Lynch had told ""lie after lie"", HP's counsel said. ,Miles, however, said on Monday that there were two levels to the case: firstly whether there were any underlying problems with Autonomy's accounts; and secondly, if there were such problems, whether Lynch was complicit.  ,He said the allegation that Lynch knew that any of Autonomy's accounts were false was ""really far-fetched"", given that he was already rich and successful and he would continue to lead Autonomy after it was acquired, by which time HP would have full access to all of the accounts. ,Closing arguments in the civil case will end this month, although further evidence could be heard in the coming months before Judge Robert Hildyard makes his judgement later in the year.  ,The United States last month formally requested the extradition of Lynch to face criminal charges including securities fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy over the 2011 HP deal. ,Hussain has already been convicted on 16 counts of wire fraud, securities fraud and conspiracy in San Francisco over the deal, and he received a five-year prison term and a $4 million fine in May. ,Hussain was granted bail in June while he appeals his conviction.

"(Reuters) - From making cars talk using Alexa's voice to managing data from factories full of robots, Amazon.com Inc (,) wants a big piece of the action in transportation, and this week at CES will unveil more about its strategy to achieve that goal than ever before. ,The Seattle retail and cloud services powerhouse plans to use the annual technology show in Las Vegas to unveil its plan to be a major player in self-driving vehicle technology, connected cars, electric vehicles and management of the torrents of data generated by automakers and drivers, company executives told Reuters. ,Amazon Web Services, which provides large-scale cloud computing and data management services, is central to Amazon's strategy.  ,""We really are extending ourselves more and more out in the ecosystem from manufacturing to connected car,"" Jon Allen, head of professional services in Amazon Web Services' automotive practice, said in a telephone interview. ""The takeaway message on this is if you go to CES this year we really are taking it as a 'One Amazon' view."" ,Until now, Amazon has shown its transportation strategy to investors - and rivals - one piece at a time. Amazon has invested in self-driving software startup Aurora. It also has signed deals with automakers to deliver packages to vehicle trunks, help develop electric vehicle charging networks and use AWS to network their factories. ,The Seattle company will share the CES stage with partners such as virtual reality firm ZeroLight, electric vehicle startup Rivian, Canada's BlackBerry Ltd (,) and video game software development company Unity Technologies. ,""It's our attempt to weave everything together in a single experience for our customers,"" Dean Phillips, AWS' automotive technical leader, told Reuters. ""Customers don't distinguish AWS from Alexa from Amazon.com. It's Amazon."" ,At CES, ZeroLight and General Motors Co's (,) Cadillac will demonstrate how they are partnering to develop an online vehicle configuration experience that will allow high-fidelity images of vehicles that consumers build online to be taken with them on visits to dealers, Phillips said.  ,The process can open the door to dealers better meeting customer needs by knowing what users focused on when building their dream car. It has already boosted profit per vehicle at Volkswagen's (,) Audi brand by an estimated 1,200 euros  ($1,340), he said. ,Rivian, in which Amazon has twice invested, will demonstrate Alexa in the R1T electric pickup truck it will begin building this fall, as well as the companion R1S SUV that will follow, Phillips said.

"PARIS (Reuters) - Margarita Louis-Dreyfus borrowed $1 billion from Credit Suisse (,) last year to buy out minority shareholders of Louis Dreyfus Company (LDC), pledging her majority stake in the commodities trader as collateral, a company filing showed. ,LDC's chairwoman, who assumed control of the 169-year-old business in 2009, faces a requirement to buy shares from family minorities wishing to sell under a long-term arrangement established by her late husband Robert. ,She said a year ago that she had completed the purchase of 16.6% of LDC's holding company from other family members, bringing her stake to about 96%. ,LDC had previously indicated that she had obtained a bank loan to finance the buyout, without giving details. ,Credit Suisse and LDC did not respond to requests for further details. ,An annual filing by Akira B.V., which represents the family trust headed by Margarita Louis-Dreyfus, said it had borrowed $1.03 billion from Credit Suisse (Switzerland) Ltd on or about Jan. 25, 2019. ,""In anticipation of the borrowing of the foregoing funds, the Company pledged all of its shares of LDHBV to Credit Suisse (Switzerland) Ltd,"" Akira said in filing, which was made in the Netherlands on Dec. 31. ,LDHBV, short for Louis Dreyfus Holding B.V., is the structure that holds the family's shares in LDC. ,The document did not indicate when the loan should be repaid. ,Last January's share buyout was the second by Margarita Louis-Dreyfus and like the previous one concluded in 2015 it followed protracted negotiations over valuation. ,The exit of most other family members could be followed by the entry of outside investors for the first time after LDC said last year that it may look at selling stakes. ,The group specified it could bring ""regional players"" into its capital, suggesting industry partners operating in one region rather than worldwide like LDC. ,In November, LDC, also known as Dreyfus, launched a cost-cutting plan after a decline in first-half profits which it blamed on international trade tensions and a swine disease epidemic in Asia. ,Dividends have offered some leverage for Margarita Louis-Dreyfus and LDC disclosed in its 2019 interim results that it had paid its biggest dividend in five years. ,Akira's filing showed it had received a dividend of $241.3 million from LDC's holding structure in March 2019. ,These dividends have reduced LDC's equity value, which the company put at $4.6 billion as of June 30 last year, versus $5 billion at the end of 2018.  ,LDC's total debt rose to $8.2 billion from $7.9 billion over the same period, although its preferred measure of adjusted debt excluding inventories rose only slightly to $3.2 billion. ,The price paid by Akira for the 16.6% stake was $824.7 million, broadly in line with previous valuations, the filing showed. ,The document also disclosed other loans by Credit Suisse to Akira and associated entities. These included more than $400 million granted in 2015, although all obligations under that facility were settled last year, it showed.

"(Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp (,) said on Monday it would cut its majority stake in pipeline operator Western Midstream Partners LP (,) to less than 50% in 2020, to reduce its debt that grew significantly with the Anadarko Petroleum Corp deal. ,Occidental's shares rose about 4% on the news, having lost over 30% in value since the $38-billion offer for Anadarko was made public on April 24, 2019. ,Occidental is working to pare $40 billion of debt it took on with the Anadarko deal, and changes to ownership would ease a sale or spin-off of Western Midstream. ,The restructuring would also allow Occidental to no longer show the gas pipeline and processing business's debt as its own. ,The net long-term debt for Occidental was $47.6 billion as of Sept. 31, 2019. ,The deal, which has been called ""hugely overpriced"" by activist investor Carl Icahn, continues to weigh on Occidental's shares, which still trade at levels it touched during the financial downturn of 2008. ,Inherited as part of the Anadarko takeover, the sale of the Western Midstream stake is a key part of Occidental's target to raise a total of $15 billion from asset sales by mid-2020. ,Occidental has raised about $10.5 billion through sales of properties, including a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique and oil production elsewhere in Africa. ,Western Midstream currently trades at a market value of over $9 billion. ,The restructuring of the Western Midstream agreements will put Occidental back on track to hive off the business, something it tried to do unsuccessfully last year. ,""I don't view the plans to reduce its ownership level to below 50% in 2020 as surprising. It's likely just a first step towards monetizing more of its ownership position over time,"" said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones. ,Occidental on Sunday gave up over 9 million shares, or a 2% stake in Western Midstream's general partner, and allowed limited partners to remove Occidental and appoint a new general partner.

"(Reuters) - Qualcomm Inc (,) on Monday announced a computing system for autonomous vehicles designed to handle everything from lane controls to full self-driving that it aims to have on the road by 2023. ,The system, dubbed Snapdragon Ride, is the company's first foray into a full system to power self-driving cars. ,San Diego-based Qualcomm, known best as the world's biggest mobile phone chip supplier, has been a major automotive supplier for more than a decade, but primarily for the modem chips that connect vehicles to the internet and chips for the infotainment systems that power screens inside vehicles. ,Qualcomm has spent years developing self-driving technology near its headquarters in virtual silence while rivals such as Intel Corp (,) and Nvidia Corp (,) jumped into the market, spending billions on acquisitions supplying major automakers for autonomous driving. ,Patrick Little, the senior vice president and general manager of Qualcomm's automotive business, said the company is using the expertise it built in the mobile phone processor business developing powerful processors that consume little electricity and generate little heat. ,Qualcomm's new computers can fit in one hand and do not need fans or liquid cooling systems to prevent them from overheating. Lower power consumption will become important in electric vehicles, in which computers will have to compete with the drive train for battery power. ,""Many of these cars have a supercomputer in the back.

"TOKYO (Reuters) - Former Nissan (,) and Renault (,) boss Carlos Ghosn began his astonishing escape from Japan with a bullet train ride from Tokyo to Osaka, possibly accompanied by several people, Japanese news agency Kyodo reported Monday. ,Japanese authorities also said on Monday they may still press for Ghosn's extradition from Lebanon to face multiple charges of financial wrongdoing, even though the country does not normally extradite its nationals. ,Security cameras captured Ghosn leaving his home on Dec. 29 at about 2:30 p.m. (0530 GMT) and arriving some hours later at Tokyo's Shinagawa Station, where he took the train to Shin Osaka Station, Kyodo said, citing a person familiar with the matter.  ,The international fugitive then went by car to a hotel near Osaka's Kansai International Airport, where he boarded a private jet at 11:10 p.m., according to the media report. ,Ghosn was forbidden from leaving Japan while awaiting trial on charges of financial misconduct, which he has denied, but he fled at the end of last year to escape what he called a ""rigged"" justice system. ,Prosecutors are now working with police to piece together Ghosn's route and find out who helped him, Kyodo said. ,In the government's first briefing since Ghosn skipped bail, Justice Minister Masako Mori said on Monday that as a general principle, Tokyo could request the extradition of a suspect from a country with which it has no formal extradition agreement. ,Such a request would need to be carefully examined based on the possibility of ""guaranteeing reciprocity and the domestic law of the partner country"", Mori told reporters in Tokyo. ,Mori did not say what would guarantee reciprocity - the idea that benefits or penalties extended by one country to citizens of another should be reciprocated. She also did not say if there were any Lebanese nationals in Japan wanted in Lebanon. ,According to a Lebanese judicial source, Lebanon has yet to receive a formal notice from Interpol requesting Ghosn's arrest and will not take any steps until it does. ,The source said on Monday that the so-called red notice it received last week had been sent directly from Japan rather than via Interpol's headquarters in Lyon, France. ,""There are questions in Wiesbaden and Lyon over the legality of sending the notification directly from Tokyo to Lebanon without passing through Interpol headquarters,"" the source said, referring to Interpol offices. ,When Lebanon has received red notices in the past, suspects have not been detained but their passports have been confiscated and bail has been set, a judicial source said last week.   ,Mori offered little insight into the events of Ghosn's escape to his ancestral home, repeatedly saying she could not comment on specifics because of an ongoing investigation. ,Japanese officials broke days of silence about the Ghosn case on Sunday, saying they would tighten immigration measures and investigate his escape thoroughly. The authorities have also issued an international notice for his arrest. ,Mori also defended Japan's justice system against Ghosn's charges that it was ""rigged"" and discriminatory. ,In Japan, suspects who deny charges against them are often detained for long periods and subject to lengthy questioning without a lawyer present, a system critics call ""hostage justice"". ,""Various comments about Japan's justice system and this unjust departure are two different things,"" Mori told reporters, saying criticism of the justice system could not be used to justify Ghosn's escape.  ,""Departure in an unjust way without proper procedure is tantamount to smuggling, an illegal departure amounting to a crime.""

"TOKYO (Reuters) - Ousted Nissan Motor Co Ltd boss Carlos Ghosn is set to hold on Wednesday his first live news conference since his arrest in November 2018 on financial misconduct charges, saying his escape from Japan has meant he can communicate ""freely"". ,The former Nissan and Renault SA chairman has denied all charges against him and said he was the victim of ""backstabbing"" and ""conspiracy"" by Nissan executives who wanted to derail his efforts to merge the two automakers. ,Ghosn, who fled to his childhood home of Lebanon just over a week ago, has gone from being one of the world's best-known businessmen to an international fugitive in a little over a year. He is due to address reporters in Beirut at 3:00 p.m. (1300 GMT) on Wednesday. ,The news conference will give Ghosn a chance to further detail his assertions that Nissan executives, with help from the Japanese government, conspired to orchestrate his downfall to prevent Nissan being merged with alliance partner Renault. ,His lawyers have previously claimed he was the victim of a ""secret task force"" formed by government officials and Nissan executives who wanted him out. ,In a video message in April, he said there were a ""few executives"" that targeted him ""for their own interest and for their own selfish fears"". ,That video was edited by his legal team to remove the names of people Ghosn accused of treachery due to legal concerns. ,Ghosn, who fled to a country which has no extradition treaty with Japan, told Fox Business that he plans to identify those he believes responsible at the news conference, the U.S. broadcaster reported. ,Ghosn is not the only senior executive at Nissan who has faced allegations of financial misconduct. An internal investigation found that former Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa and other executives received improper compensation. ,That forced Saikawa to step down last year. The former CEO and one-time Ghosn protege has said he received the stock-related compensation under ""a scheme of the Ghosn era"". ,Attention has also focused on another Nissan executive who helped oust Ghosn but was later hit himself by allegations of overpayment. Nissan has said its investigation had found no evidence against the executive, Hari Nada, who has since been demoted. ,Renault's former CEO Thierry Bollore sought to flag alleged conflicts of interest and governance problems at Nissan before departing the French automaker, France's Le Monde has reported, citing a letter he wrote to the board. ,Bollore told the board he was particularly concerned by the revelation that Nissan had a list of 80 managers implicated in financial dealings similar to the ones attributed to Ghosn. ,He also raised questions over the internal investigation surrounding Ghosn and issues with the chain of command at Nissan, saying some key board members were sometimes not informed about internal matters, Le Monde reported. ,Nissan has denied there were any irregularities in its investigation of Ghosn's affairs, and said the automaker had reviewed its processes again following Bollore's letter. ,Ghosn's legal team has previously argued it was being denied access to a trove of digital data collected by prosecutors from Nissan and its employees. ,Prosecutors have declined to release 6,000 pieces of evidence because of concerns voiced by Nissan that the evidence includes sensitive information about the automaker's operations or personal information about its employees. ,The automaker reported a 70% drop in quarterly profit in November and cut its full-year forecast to an 11-year low amid falling sales.  ,Its share price fell 27% last year, marking the worst annual performance in more than a decade, and adding to a 22% decline in 2018. ,The automaker has embarked on a turnaround plan to roll back the expansionist strategy championed by Ghosn, but that effort has been complicated by the ouster of Saikawa, and more recently, the resignation of executive Jun Seki who was tasked with leading the recovery.

"WASHINGTON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - The U.S. trade deficit fell to a more than three-year low in November as imports declined further, likely weighed down by the Trump administration's trade war with China, and exports rebounded, suggesting the economy ended 2019 on solid footing. ,The Commerce Department said on Tuesday the trade deficit decreased 8.2% to $43.1 billion, the smallest since October 2016. The percentage drop was the largest since January. ,The trade deficit has narrowed 0.7% through November and is on track to record its first annual decline since 2013. While the shrinking trade bill should provide a boost to gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, falling consumer goods imports also suggest a cooling in domestic demand. ,Data for October was revised to show the trade gap declining to $46.9 billion instead of the previously reported $47.2 billion. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade gap narrowing to $43.8 billion in November. ,The goods trade deficit with China, the focus of the White House's ""America First"" agenda tumbled 15.7% to $26.4 billion, with imports dropping 9.2% and exports jumping 13.7%. The goods trade gap with the European Union fell 20.2% to $13.1 billion. ,The United States and China are embroiled in a bruising trade war, and Washington has also tussled with other trading partners, including the European Union, Brazil and Argentina, accusing them of devaluing their currencies at the expense of U.S. manufacturers. ,Though Washington and Beijing in December hammered out a ""Phase 1"" trade deal, considerable confusion remains about the details of the agreement. President Donald Trump said last Tuesday that the partial deal would be signed on Jan. 15 at the White House. ,The 18-month-long U.S.-China trade war has undermined business investment, which together with slowing growth overseas have led to a recession in manufacturing. Economists expect manufacturing to continue to struggle without a complete rolling back of tariffs. ,When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit decreased $3.7 billion to $75.3 billion in November, the smallest since March 2017. The so-called real trade deficit so far in the fourth quarter is below the average for the July-September period. Economists expect trade will add at least 1.5 percentage points to GDP growth in the fourth quarter after being a drag for two straight quarters. ,The Atlanta Federal Reserve is forecasting GDP increasing at a 2.3% annualized rate in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the third quarter. ,In November, goods imports dropped 1.4% to $201.1 billion, declining for a third straight month. Consumer goods imports fell $1.0 billion, pulled down by declines in cellphones and other household items, and artwork and other collectibles. ,Economists believe consumer goods imports were weighed down by a 15% tariff on $110 billion worth of Chinese goods that came into effect on Sept. 1. They also say anticipation that the ""Phase 1"" trade agreement would roll back the tariffs could have encouraged companies to hold off on imports. ,The drop in consumer goods imports points to a slower pace of consumer spending in the October-December quarter after two straight quarters of brisk growth. ,Capital goods imports dropped $1.2 billion in November, reflecting decreases in civilian aircraft and computers. Crude oil imports tumbled to 166.4 million barrels, the lowest since February 1992, from 188.3 million barrels in October. Motor vehicle and parts imports, however, rose $1.1 billion. ,Goods exports rose 0.7% to $137.2 billion in November. They were boosted by a $0.6 billion increase in shipments of capital goods.

"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's largest and longest debt saga, fueled by a feud that has split one of its richest families, could be nearing a resolution after a court approved about $14 billion in claims related to the collapse of two business empires a decade ago. ,The Saudi court has accepted more than $7 billion in claims from creditors against the Algosaibi family's conglomerate AHAB, and about $6.5 billion against tycoon Maan al-Sanea and his company Saad Group, two court documents seen by Reuters showed. ,The Algosaibis and Sanea - who married into the Algosaibi family - have been locked into a bitter dispute over who was to blame for the 2009 collapse of the companies.  ,Both sides deny wrongdoing, but the demise of the two companies nonetheless left dozens of local and international banks with billions of dollars of unpaid debt. ,A court-driven end to the saga would not only offer some relief to those creditors, but more broadly would be an important sign to international investors, as the cases would be resolved under a new bankruptcy law introduced in 2018 as part of reforms aimed at making the kingdom more investor friendly. ,The Dammam Commercial Court last week approved more than $7 billion of claims against AHAB (Ahmad Hamad Algosaibi and Bros.) out of nearly $12 billion in total claims listed, according to one of the documents seen by Reuters. ,In December the court approved around $6.5 billion of claims against Sanea and Saad out of nearly $18 billion of listed claims, excluding those filed by the group's employees, according to a separate document. ,Simon Charlton, chief restructuring officer at AHAB, confirmed the approval of the claims against the company. ,""The trustee has requested the court for permission to form a creditors committee and we hope that we can get a committee formed quickly and then finalize a proposal with a target to get a creditor vote on a proposal that can be presented to the court for ratification within 90 days,"" he told Reuters. ,A legal representative for Saad Group and Sanea did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Saudi government's media office also did not immediately respond. ,The approved creditors' demands will now be included in restructuring proposals which the debtors and representatives of their respective lenders will submit to the court. ,The court approved claims from over 70 financial institutions in the AHAB case, including Saudi and regional banks, and international lenders such as BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and JPMorgan, the document showed. ,But it rejected two of four claims by The International Bank Corporation (TIBC), a Bahraini bank which has around $3 billion in claims against AHAB. The bank had raised money in international markets, transferring the funds to AHAB. ,Some $1.8 billion worth of TIBC claims were approved out of the $3 billion, according to the court document. ,A spokesman for the administrators of TIBC, whose default in 2009 was at the center of Saudi Arabia's financial meltdown that year, said they planned to appeal against the court's rejection of two of its claims ""as they represent claims that are no less worthy than the other two"". ,($1 = 3.7510 riyals) ",Business News,1/7/2020 11:56,"A Saudi family feud, a decade-long debt saga and a court's $14 billion decision"

Fears of a recession that dominated last summer have sharply receded. ,""The economy may be pulling out of a rough patch,"" said Maria Cosma, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ,The Commerce Department said the trade deficit decreased 8.2% to $43.1 billion in November, the smallest since October 2016. The trade gap narrowed 0.7% through November and is on track to record its first annual decline since 2013. Though the shrinking trade bill should be a boost to gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, falling consumer and capital goods imports also suggest a cooling in domestic demand.  ,Economists polled by Reuters had forecast the trade shortfall tightening to $43.8 billion in November. The goods trade deficit with China, the focus of the White House's ""America First"" agenda tumbled 15.7% to $26.4 billion, with imports dropping 9.2% and exports jumping 13.7%. The goods trade deficit with the European Union fell 20.2% to $13.1 billion. ,The United States and China are embroiled in a bruising trade war, and the White House has also tussled with other trading partners, including the European Union, Brazil and Argentina, accusing them of devaluing their currencies at the expense of U.S. manufacturers.  ,Though Washington and Beijing in December hammered out a ""Phase 1"" trade deal, considerable confusion remains about the details of the agreement. President Donald Trump said last Tuesday that the partial deal would be signed on Jan. 15 at the White House. ,The 18-month-long U.S.-China trade war has undermined business investment, which together with slowing growth overseas have led to a recession in manufacturing. Economists expect manufacturing to continue to struggle without a complete rolling back of tariffs. Manufacturing's troubles do not appear to have significantly spilled over to the services industries. ,In a separate report on Tuesday, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its non-manufacturing activity index rose to a reading of 55.0 last month from 53.9 in November. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in the services sector, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity. ,But services industries reported a moderation in growth in new orders and hiring. The report came on the heels of a survey from the ISM last week showing its measure of national factory activity dropping in December to its lowest level since June 2009, and contracting for a fifth straight month.  ,The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields were steady, while stocks on Wall Street fell. ,When adjusted for inflation, the goods trade deficit decreased $3.7 billion to $75.3 billion in November, the smallest since March 2017. The so-called real trade deficit so far in the fourth quarter is below the average for the July-September period.  ,Economists expect trade will add at least 1.5 percentage points to GDP growth in the fourth quarter after being a drag for two straight quarters. The boost from trade is, however, expected to be partially offset by a moderation in the pace of inventory accumulation. ,The Atlanta Fed is forecasting GDP increasing at a 2.3% annualized rate in the fourth quarter. The economy grew at a 2.1% pace in the third quarter. ,In November, goods imports dropped 1.4% to $201.1 billion, declining for a third straight month. Consumer goods imports fell $1.0 billion, pulled down by declines in cellphones and other household items, and artwork and other collectibles. ,Economists believe consumer goods imports were depressed by a 15% tariff on $110 billion worth of Chinese goods that came into effect on Sept. 1. They also say anticipation that the ""Phase 1"" trade agreement would roll back the tariffs could have encouraged companies to hold off on imports. A rebound in imports is expected. ,""If, as we expect, the recent decline in imports is due to importers pulling forward demand to get ahead of consumer-focused tariffs, it may be set to reverse and be a drag on GDP in coming quarters,"" said Tim Quinlan, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.   ,The drop in consumer goods imports points to a slower pace of consumer spending in the October-December quarter after two straight quarters of brisk growth. Capital goods imports dropped $1.2 billion in November, reflecting decreases in civilian aircraft and computers, and suggesting continued weakness in business investment. ,Crude oil imports tumbled to 166.4 million barrels, the lowest since February 1992, from 188.3 million barrels in October. That contributed to a record petroleum surplus.   ,Goods exports rose 0.7% to $137.2 billion in November. They were boosted by a $0.6 billion increase in shipments of capital goods. Consumer goods exports advanced $0.5 billion.  ",Business News,1/7/2020 14:14,U.S. trade deficit at three-year low as imports tumble

"LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is making a final pitch to Britain ahead of a UK decision on whether to upgrade its telecoms network with Huawei equipment, amid threats to cut intelligence-sharing ties, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. ,Britain is expected to make a final call on how to deploy Huawei equipment in its future 5G networks later this month, weighing U.S.-led allegations that the equipment could be used for Chinese state spying against Britain's relationship with Beijing and industry warnings that banning the firm outright would cost billions of dollars.  ,Huawei, the world's largest maker of mobile networking equipment, has repeatedly denied the allegations. A company spokesman said UK lawmakers had confirmed Huawei equipment would not be deployed in networks used for intelligence sharing. ,""Our 5G equipment does not pose a threat to information security,"" he said. ""We are confident the UK government will take an evidence-based approach when making its decision about Huawei's inclusion in the 5G network."" ,U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to press British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab over Huawei at a meeting in Washington on Thursday, the sources said. ,Ahead of the decision, Washington had also planned to send a delegation, including deputy national security adviser Matt Pottinger, to meet with British officials this week, sources said. But the trip was cancelled at the last minute, two of the people said, due to bad weather.   ,Last month, the United States also passed legislation that included a provision bolstering threats to restrict intelligence-sharing with allies that use Huawei equipment. ,Washington is seen to be ""cocking the pistol,"" said a person with knowledge of the British government's position on Huawei. ""What's unclear is how, when or indeed if it will actually be fired."" ,A UK government spokesman said: ""The security and resilience of the UK's telecoms networks is of paramount importance. The government continues to consider its position on high-risk vendors and a decision will be made in due course."" ,The U.S. State Department and National Security Council did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ,Britain is a key battleground in the geopolitical tug-of-war over Huawei.

"MADRID/HANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - After years of reconnaissance, China's retail king Alibaba is finally making its move on Europe. It is undercutting Amazon sellers' fees to attract vendors but has had mixed results, six sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. ,A flood of small businesses have joined its European platform, AliExpress, in recent months but some larger brands are holding back, according to the sources. ,AliExpress has approached well-known brands including Mango, Benetton and Spanish fashion group Tendam, owner of Cortefiel, to appear on the site with limited success, according to five sources involved in the approaches who declined to be named because the discussions were confidential. ,Some of the brands did not feel the site, whose fashion offerings include an imitation leather miniskirt for about $18 and an acrylic batwing sweater for $14, was the right showcase for their products, sources said.  ,A senior executive at one large fashion company, which turned down AliExpress's approaches in Europe, said its brand needed to be in an ""aspirational environment"". Another described the AliExpress platform as ""a work in progress"". ,However the head of AliExpress, Wang Mingqiang, told Reuters in an interview at Alibaba's headquarters in Hangzhou, that foreign brands needed time to understand the platform.  ,With space to design their own stores within the platform, brands can build their own homepage, with pictures and video, to create the feel they want, he added. ,Both Benetton and Tendam declined to comment officially on whether they were approached. Neither brand sells on AliExpress but they do sell on Amazon. Mango said it did not sell on AliExpress with no further comment. It does not sell on Amazon (,). ,An AliExpress spokeswoman did not comment on whether the company had approached these brands or others. ,""We are continuously exploring opportunities to work with different partners and committed to acting as a trusted partner for both consumers and sellers,"" the company said. ,Alibaba has hitherto focused on selling inexpensive Chinese products overseas through its AliExpress platform, such as $3 USB cables and $2 crystal earrings, curbing its appeal to a wider audience. ,But in the past six months it has started a drive to open up the platform to local vendors and brands as its seeks to replicate a highly profitable model of virtual malls that has seen it swallow more than half of online sales in China.  ,""Overseas sellers have a better understanding of local users, their products have better designs as they are closer to local users,"" said Wang.  ,The company is initially targeting Spain and Italy, plus the Europe-Asia gateway nations of Russia and Turkey, among its top markets under the previous, first-phase business model launched in 2010.    ,Spain, a big Western country with strong local brands, is the kind of market Alibaba needs to win over if it is to meet CEO Daniel Zhang's target to more than double its customer base to 2 billion by 2036 despite a stuttering Chinese economy. ,Its progress there illustrates its strategy, and the obstacles it could encounter, as it plots global expansion. ,AliExpress has waived monthly rates for sellers in Spain to attract their business while commissions for goods sold are set at 5% to 8%, according to a senior source close to the company.  ,By comparison, it costs 39 euros per month plus sales tax to sell on Amazon, plus a commission for every object sold of 7% to 15%, with some items like jewelry and Amazon device accessories commanding higher rates, an Amazon spokeswoman said. ,Amazon declined to comment on AliExpress's move to open its platform to local sellers. The U.S. company is the largest online shopping marketplace in its five main European markets: Britain, France, Germany, Italy and Spain, according to e-commerce analyst Marketplace Pulse. ,Thousands of small businesses have signed up to register on AliExpress in Spain since it was opened up to local sellers in 2019, an AliExpress spokeswoman said.  ,She declined to be more specific, but that would compare favorably with established Amazon, which said more than 8,000 small Spanish businesses sold on its platform in 2018.  ,In one of AliExpress's most high-profile signings so far, Spanish department store El Corte Ingles said in June it would boost its presence on the platform to seven fashion lines.  ,Spanish cosmetics start-up Le Tout started to sell on AliExpress in 2019 when the platform opened to local sellers.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. private payrolls increased by the most in eight months in December, pointing to sustained labor market strength though job gains last month were likely flattered by a seasonal quirk. ,The ADP National Employment Report on Wednesday showed private payrolls jumped by 202,000 jobs last month, the largest gain since April, after an upwardly revised 124,000 rise in November. Private job growth averaged 163,000 jobs per month in 2019, slowing from an average increase of 219,000 in 2018.   ,Economists polled by Reuters had forecast private payrolls advancing 160,000 last month following a previously reported 67,000 rise in November. ,ADP private payrolls tend to surge in December because of adjustment difficulties related to the purging of employees who have permanently left company payrolls. According economists, some companies keep workers who have resigned on their payrolls until they file year-end tax documents. In contrast, in the government's more-comprehensive employment report, workers who are no longer getting paid are dropped from the data. ,""The accuracy of the ADP's first estimate of monthly employment growth has never been anywhere near as good as we would have expected given the richness of the data source,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics in Toronto. ""Nevertheless, this latest ADP reading supports our view that employment and GDP growth held up surprisingly well in the fourth quarter, even though some of the survey evidence weakened further."" ,The dollar was trading marginally higher against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury yields fell. Stocks on Wall Street rose in part as Iran appeared to signal that overnight missile strikes ""concluded"" its retaliation for the U.S. killing of General Qassem Soleimani. ,The ADP report, which is jointly developed with Moody's Analytics, was published ahead of the Labor Department's employment report for December scheduled for release on Friday. Even discounting the December distortions, the ADP report generally has a poor record predicting the private payrolls component of the government's employment report because of the differences in methodology.  ,According to a Reuters survey of economists, nonfarm payrolls likely increased by 164,000 jobs last month after surging 266,000 in November. The unemployment rate is forecast steady near a 50-year low of 3.5%. ,""The ADP data also were much weaker than the government data in November so, the strength in the December ADP report may be payback for the softness in November that may not show up in the government data,"" said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York. ,The ADP report showed employment in the goods-producing sector increased by 29,000 jobs in December. Manufacturing payrolls fell by 7,000 jobs last month and construction added 37,000 positions, likely boosted by unseasonably mild weather. Natural resources and mining shed 1,000 jobs. ,The services sector added 173,000 jobs last month, with gains concentrated in health services, professional and business services, and trade, transportation and utilities.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors are worrying that rising energy costs due to an escalating conflict between the United States and Iran that has caused a spike in oil prices will hurt U.S. corporate earnings.  ,Oil prices briefly jumped to four-month highs overnight after Iran launched missiles at U.S.-led forces in Iraq, but retreated after signs that further military action may been limited. [O/R] Despite that pullback, oil prices remain nearly 25% higher over the last 12 months, due in part to rising tensions in the Middle East. ,While the energy sector would benefit from higher oil prices, profit margins in other sectors ranging from shipping to manufacturing to restaurants would narrow as gasoline prices rise. Some investors said they were acting more defensively against this backdrop.   ,""Oil is still not prohibitively expensive, but it's significantly more expensive than it was when companies were making their budgets a year ago,"" said John LaForge, head of real asset strategy for Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""They might have the ability to pass it on or they might not, but overall there is going to be a hit to margins.""  ,At $67 a barrel LCOc1, the price of oil remains far below the level that would send the United States into an immediate recession. Yet higher energy costs at a time of heightened geopolitical risks are likely to leave investors and companies skittish, fund managers and analysts said.   ,The conflict between the United States and Iran escalated early on Wednesday with a retaliatory Iranian missile attack , on U.S.-led forces in Iraq for the U.S. killing of an Iranian general days earlier [nL1N29D006.]  ,Yet oil futures fell after tweets by U.S. President Donald Trump and Iran's foreign minister seemed to signal that further military action was not forthcoming. Trump had ordered a drone strike , on Friday that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani.  ,The benchmark S&P 500 index , posted modest gains in midday trading on Wednesday.  ,First-quarter earnings of companies in the S&P 500 are expected to rise 6.2% from a year earlier, according to estimates from Refinitiv made before the recent jump in oil prices. Those estimates were largely based on assumptions that economic growth will rebound in 2020, though corporate earnings are expected to have fallen by 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019. Companies will begin reporting results next week.  ,WAKE-UP CALL  ,The likelihood that oil stays near current levels or moves higher will push more investors into a defensive crouch until it becomes clearer how companies are responding, said Barry James, a portfolio manager at James Investment Research.  ,""Stocks are not cheap and we've had this huge run-up and sentiment had gotten dangerously bullish,"" he said. ""I would want to have at least a moderate position in energy if I didn't have any and some gold in my portfolio.""  ,The attacks should serve as a wake-up call to investors who piled into stocks during the S&P 500's months-long rally, said Christopher Stanton, chief investment officer at San Diego-based Sunrise Capital LLC. ,""We've had three months of asymmetric upward moves in the equity markets,"" he said. ""Things have become increasingly overbought. If you're an investor, don't you want to take it easy here and back off a bit?""  ,Still, oversupply in the global oil market and the emergence of the United States as the world's top oil producer will likely keep oil below $75 a barrel. That is, as long as the conflict between the United States and Iran does not escalate to the point where Iran attempts to close the Strait of Hormuz, a chokepoint through which about a fifth of the world's oil supply flows, LaForge said, as he put the price of oil in perspective.  ,""This is still a small move, historically speaking,"" he said.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. Federal Reserve official said on Wednesday that bank regulators should pursue a more nuanced approach to updating community lending standards for banks. ,Fed Governor Lael Brainard argued that a new uniform standard proposed by other U.S. banking regulators would fail to account for differences across communities nationwide, and also said regulators should apply an additional test to larger banks. ,U.S. regulators are endeavoring to update rules around the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act, which requires regulators to assess how well banks are serving the needs of lower-income communities. The rules were last updated in 1995. ,The Fed shares responsibility for enforcing the CRA with two other bank regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. But those two regulators proposed a rule update in December without the U.S. central bank's support, which would establish a uniform standard to evaluate all banks' efforts to support lower-income communities.  ,But Brainard, who is in charge of the Fed's attempt to update the rule, argued against such a broad-based approach, saying it failed to capture differences in communities with different amounts of lower-income families, as well as changes in the business cycle.  ,""Any comprehensive and uniform metric does have the risk of unintended consequences (and) of not being responsive to local community needs,"" she said at an event in Washington. ,She added that while the other regulators are moving aggressively to rewrite the rules sometime in 2020, the Fed is not feeling the same pressure despite a desire to ultimately get all three agencies to agree on a consistent rule. ,""It's extremely important to eventually find common ground,"" she said. ""It is so much more important, in my view, to get this done right than to get it done fast."" ,Beyond evaluating a bank's retail lending and banking services, Brainard also said larger banks should face an extra, broader test on how they support communities overall through larger financing projects.

"BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil (Reuters) - A Brazilian state prosecutor expects to bring criminal charges ""in the next few days"" against miner Vale (,) over a mining waste dam collapse that killed at least 259 people, even as the prosecutor's federal counterpart continues to investigate the case. ,Andressa de Oliveira Lanchotti, coordinator for the task force of state prosecutors investigating the disaster, told Reuters they expect to indict 15 to 20 people, including executives from Vale and employees from German inspection firm TÜV SÜD - as well as the companies themselves.  ,""What we can take away from the investigations is there were several factors pointing to risk - the risk was not unknown,"" Lanchotti said, disputing Vale's contention that it had no way of knowing that the dam that unleashed an avalanche of mining waste on the Brazilian town of Brumadinho in January 2019 posed a danger.  ,Federal police in September proposed criminal charges against Vale, TÜV SÜD and 13 of their employees, accusing the companies of working with falsified documents attesting to the stability of the dam. ,Prosecutors believe TÜV SÜD had a vested interest in signing off on the dam's safety so that it could get more work from Vale, which had fired another inspection firm which refused to certify the dam's safety. ,""There was a conflict of interest between TÜV SÜD and Vale because TÜV SÜD had lucrative contracts with Vale for other activities, to decommission dams, which makes obvious the regulatory shortcomings here,"" she said. ,A Vale spokesman said a panel of experts appointed by its lawyers found that the Brumadinho collapse had happened ""abruptly and without apparent previous signs that could have been detected by geotechnical monitoring instruments usually employed by the global mining industry."" ,In the same emailed statement, the spokesman said Vale had hired TÜV SÜD with the understanding that its inspectors would have ""technical responsibilities, independence and autonomy in carrying out its services ... prioritizing safety above all.""   ,TÜV SÜD declined to comment. ,Prosecutors appear eager to unveil charges against Vale ahead of the one-year anniversary of Brazil's deadliest tailings dam disaster later this month, but a leading federal prosecutor told Reuters their investigation was weeks from wrapping up.  ,The federal prosecutor's office in Minas Gerais state said it had hired geological experts from the University of Catalunya in Spain to examine what triggered the collapse at Brumadinho. That investigation will take until February and could be crucial in establishing Vale's culpability, federal prosecutor Jose Adercio Leite Sampaio said in an interview.  ,Federal and state prosecutors have pledged to coordinate more closely in the Brumadinho investigation, acknowledging that the probe into Brazil's last big mining disaster - a dam burst at a joint venture between Vale and Anglo-Australian miner BHP Group (,) - was undermined by disputes over areas of responsibility. ,Prosecutors did not make it clear whether they were planning to charge current or former executives at Vale, which has distanced itself from several people investigated after the Brumadinho disaster. Rescuers have found 259 bodies in the months following the collapse, which swamped nearby buildings, forests and waterways with mud mixed with mining waste. Another 11 people are still missing.  ,Lanchotti and Sampaio both agreed that Vale may need to make more governance changes to improve risk management practices. ,""The federal public prosecutors' office has identified serious risk management and corporate governance problems that show a need for profound changes,"" Sampaio said.  ,The Vale spokesman said the company ""has always been committed to the safety of people and its structures and continues to improve its risk management processes,"" adding that it had ""provided all documents and information sought by the competent authorities.""

"WASHINGTON/MONTREAL (Reuters) - Major airlines canceled Iran and Iraq flights on Wednesday and re-routed others away from both countries' airspace following an Iranian missile strike on U.S.-led forces in Iraq. ,Germany's Lufthansa, Dubai-based Emirates and low-cost flydubai were among airlines that canceled flights, as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration barred American carriers from the area. But several other carriers continued operations over the affected airspace. ,Iran early on Wednesday fired more than a dozen ballistic missiles from its territory targeting at least two Iraqi military bases hosting U.S.-led coalition personnel, the U.S. military said. ,Within hours, the FAA barred U.S. carriers from airspace over Iran, the Gulf of Oman and the waters between Iran and Saudi Arabia, citing ""heightened military activities and increased political tensions in the Middle East, which present an inadvertent risk to U.S. civil aviation operations"". ,The flight ban came shortly before a Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737 burst into flames shortly after take-off from Tehran, killing all 176 people aboard in a crash blamed by Ukrainian authorities on an engine failure. ,Non-U.S. operators are not bound by the FAA decision, but they and other regulators consider its advice carefully when determining where to fly. Later on Wednesday, the EU Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) recommended to national authorities that European carriers avoid Iraqi airspace.  ,Airlines have taken more steps to avoid flying over conflict zones since 2014, when Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was downed by a missile launched from Ukraine, killing 298 people. But re-routing increases flight times and burns extra fuel. ,Australia's Qantas Airways said on Wednesday it would add 50 minutes to its Perth-London flight time and cut passenger numbers to carry more fuel as it re-routes around Iran and Iraq. ,The FAA had already prohibited U.S. carriers from Iranian airspace and from flying below 26,000 feet over Iraq, after Iran shot down a high-altitude U.S. drone last June. ,(GRAPHIC: Iran fires missiles at U.S bases in Iraq - ,) ,Lufthansa dropped its next scheduled flights to Erbil in northern Iraq and to Tehran but said services to the Iranian capital would resume on Thursday, although overflights will continue to be re-routed to avoid both countries' airspace. ,Air France-KLM, which axed its Tehran service in 2018, said it was also suspending Air France flights through Iranian and Iraqi airspace ""as a precautionary measure"". ,British Airways said a small number of its flights would be affected by re-routing, without elaborating. Virgin Atlantic, Singapore Airlines Ltd, Malaysia Airlines, Air Canada and Taiwan's China Airlines were also among carriers that re-routed flights. ,""As a result, flight times to and from Mumbai may be slightly longer than expected,"" a Virgin spokeswoman said. ,Other major airlines maintained flights over Iraq and Iran but said they were actively monitoring the situation. ,As of 0830 GMT, airlines still flying over either country included Qatar Airways, Emirates, Etihad Airways, Turkish Airlines, flydubai, Air Arabia and low-cost long-haul carrier Norwegian Air, according to FlightRadar24 data. ,Norwegian, whose Dubai flights routinely cross Iran, nonetheless said it was ""looking at alternative routes"" for flights departing Scandinavia later in the day. ""The safety and security for our passengers and crew is always our number one priority,"" it added. ,While Emirates and flydubai each canceled a return flight to Baghdad, Qatar Airways said its flights to Iraq were operating normally. ,The use of Iranian and Iraqi airspace is particularly critical for the Qatari carrier, banned from flying over Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain since mid-2017 as the result of a damaging political dispute with its neighbors.  ,OPSGROUP, which advises airlines on security, said the new U.S. flight bans were ""significant"", particularly given that the entire over-water airspace in the region is now unavailable. ,""Flights headed to and from the main airports in the region such as Dubai will now need to route through Saudi Arabia's airspace,"" it said on its website.

" (This January 7 story corrects paragraph 11 to show CAE is based in Montreal, not Toronto) ,By David Shepardson and Tracy Rucinski ,(Reuters) - Boeing Co (,) said on Tuesday it was recommending that airline pilots undergo simulator training before they resume flying the 737 MAX, a shift from its previous position that pilots only needed computer-based training. ,If U.S. and international regulators ultimately back Boeing's proposal, it could take airlines longer to prepare their crews to fly the 737 MAX jets that have been grounded since March after two crashes that killed 346 people.      ,Boeing has been working on revised pilot training and software updates for the 737 MAX to win regulatory approval for the jets to fly commercially again.  ,After repeated setbacks, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is not expected to give the greenlight until at least February, perhaps March or later. ,Last year, the planemaker said it would propose that MAX pilots did not need to train on costly simulators, a position it originally used to market the latest version of its 737 narrowbody workhorse against competition from European rival Airbus SE (,). ,Airlines that bought the MAX have had to cancel flights while the global fleet remains grounded. ,If only computer-based training were required for renewed 737 MAX commercial flying, Boeing's largest customer Southwest Airlines Co (,) had said it would take one to two months to prepare its more than 9,500 pilots on the updates. ,Southwest had not been part of Boeing's recent discussions on pilot training recommendations and could not provide additional cost or timing estimates before there was specific guidance, spokeswoman Brandy King said. ,Southwest has three MAX simulators in various stages of FAA certification and expects three more later this year. ,American Airlines Group Inc (,) and United Airlines (,) each have one MAX simulator.  ,Not many MAX simulators exist and it was unclear if training could be performed on the 737 NG simulator that 737 pilots have used until now. As of December, Montreal-based CAE Inc (,) had delivered 23 MAX full-flight simulators, a spokeswoman said. ,The FAA said on Tuesday it will consider Boeing's recommendations during training evaluations of U.S. and international flight crew alongside regulators from Canada, Europe and Brazil. ,Canada's Transport Minister Marc Garneau, who has leaned toward mandatory simulator training for Canadian 737 MAX operators, said in a statement that Boeing's signaling the importance of such training was ""encouraging."" ,U.S. and European aviation safety regulators are meeting with Boeing this week in an effort to complete a 737 MAX software documentation audit - an important step toward the eventual return to service. ,Boeing shares closed 1% higher on Tuesday following unconfirmed reports that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (,) is buying the company's stock.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - McDonald's Corp (,) said on Wednesday it will expand its trial in Canada of vegan burgers made by Beyond Meat (,) as the world's biggest fast food chain tests the viability of a broader rollout.      ,McDonald's initial 12-week test late last year of its so-called ""P.L.T."" burger at 28 locations in Southwestern Ontario will grow to a total of 52 locations on Jan. 14 and run for another three months. ,Analysts, rival fast food companies and plant-based protein producers are watching McDonald's to see whether the P.L.T. is popular enough to justify wider distribution, particularly in the United States, its biggest market. ,While other chains have already started selling plant-based meat - including Restaurant Brands International Inc's (,) Burger King, White Castle and Dunkin' Brands Group Inc (,) - a McDonald's contract would likely be the biggest and put the plant-based meat movement front and center in mainstream America. ,Reuters reported on Tuesday that Beyond Meat rival Impossible Foods is no longer trying to win a deal with McDonald's because it does not currently have the capacity to supply the fast food giant. ,Beyond Meat shares, which closed up 12.5% on Tuesday after the news, were down 1.4 percent on Wednesday. ,Graphic designer Jeff McClinchey had not been to a McDonald's restaurant since 1999. But in the last couple months, McClinchey – a vegetarian – has been twice to eat the P.L.T. ,""I liked it. It hit that nostalgic factor,"" McClinchey told Reuters while shopping at a comic store in London, Ontario, last month. ,A report from the Canadian newspaper Financial Post, citing a McDonald's executive, said the test would help the company determine who is buying the sandwich, but that so far the P.L.T. had the right name and recipe. (,) ,McDonald's confirmed to Reuters that demand for the item was higher in urban areas, and one franchisee with more rural locations opted out of the second phase of the test. ,Southwestern Ontario, particularly the city of London and surrounding areas, has long been the ""guinea pig of Canada"" to test new products, said Gerry McCartney, CEO of the London Chamber of Commerce. ,The area, about two hours southwest of Toronto, has the perfect demographic mix as a diverse but hard-to-win market, according to locals and experts interviewed by Reuters. ,Traditionally a farming community surrounded by conservative agricultural and industrial areas, it is close to the United States and has an urban core with more liberal pockets. ,It has a big university, as well as a number of residents from Europe and other countries, and even boasts Canada's first 24-hour vegan fast food drive-thru restaurant, called Globally Local. ,UBS said in December that McDonald's could sell more than 250 million P.L.T. sandwiches annually if it rolled out the product across its nearly 14,000 U.S. outlets, based on the Swiss investment bank's tests that showed McDonald's was selling nearly 100 burgers a day at some outlets.

"SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Impossible Foods is no longer trying to win a coveted deal to supply McDonald's Corp (,) with plant-based burgers, telling Reuters it cannot produce enough of its imitation meat to partner with the world's No. 1 fast-food chain. ,It is the latest twist in the battle of imitation-meat makers hoping to convince more restaurants to offer their patties. But it was unclear how far talks had progressed with McDonald's, which declined to comment on the discussions.  ,Shares of Impossible rival Beyond Meat (,) surged on Tuesday, closing 12.5% higher, after Reuters reported that Impossible was no longer in talks with McDonald's. ,The stock had risen earlier in the day on Impossible's unveiling of its plant-based pork products at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Monday, spurring further optimism about the sector. ,Referring to McDonald's, Impossible Foods CEO Pat Brown told Reuters in an interview that ""it would be stupid for us to be vying for them right now ... Having more big customers right now doesn't do us any good until we scale up production."" ,Impossible Foods and its rivals are duking it out over partnerships with fast-food chains to cash in on the roughly $3,500 per person average that Americans spend each year on food away from home.    ,The privately held, Silicon Valley-based Impossible Foods teamed up with Burger King last year to launch its soy-based Impossible Whopper in the United States. Impossible Foods is now working to more than double production instead of trying to win a deal the size of McDonald's, Brown said. ,""I wish we had vastly more capacity than we do right now because the demand is high,"" he said. Impossible Foods said it had previously met with McDonald's but declined to disclose details about when it decided it would be unable to support a potential deal. ,In late September, McDonald's launched a 12-week test of a P.L.T. burger in Canada, using patties made by Beyond Meat. But McDonald's has yet to offer a plant-based burger as a regular feature on its menu at any of its roughly 14,000 U.S. outlets.  ,""The P.L.T. is a craveable plant-based burger with a patty recipe that is made by McDonald's, for McDonald's,"" the fast-food chain said in a statement. It declined to provide any specifics on the results of the Canada test. ,Beyond Meat told Reuters that talks with McDonald's are going ""very well"" and that its new and upcoming facilities around the world are guaranteed to help it keep up with demand - not just in the United States, but globally. ,""We would have to work with them (McDonald's) on timing but, yes, we would be able to meet their demand globally,"" Beyond Meat's chief growth officer, Chuck Muth, said last month in an interview at the Los Angeles-based company's office. ,Beyond Meat, which is valued at about $5 billion after its IPO in May, weathered supply issues in 2017 and 2018, when hamburger chain A&W Canada ran out of Beyond Burgers soon after launching nationwide. But Muth said recently announced facilities in Canada and the Netherlands would prevent future snafus.  ,Beyond Meat, whose products are made with pea protein, told Reuters in November that it aims to have production up and running in Asia by the end of next year. ,""Beyond Meat doesn't want to drop the ball while there is amazing awareness building in the market, and they need to balance that with not over-committing themselves,"" said Dan Altschuler Malek, managing partner at Beyond Meat investor Unovis Partners. ""The industry will continue to talk about pressure on supply for years – not because output hasn't increased but because consumer demand continues to exceed expectations."" ,McDonald's typically works with multiple suppliers to provide components for major menu items like burgers and French fries. Other fast-food companies - including Yum! Brands' (,) KFC and Dunkin Brands – have tested and rolled out plant-based versions of items on their menus, made by dominant suppliers Beyond Meat or Impossible Foods. ,Impossible Foods declined to comment on when it believes it might have enough supply or manufacturing capacity to partner with McDonald's. ,""When we are ready to do it, we would certainly like them to be a customer,"" Impossible's CEO, Brown, said. ""Right now, if McDonald's said they wanted us to be in all the restaurants, we'd have to say 'Sorry, we can't do it.'"" ,Impossible Foods has had capacity issues that have hurt customers in the past.

"(Reuters) - Takata is recalling 10 million replacement air bag inflators in the United States, the largest ever auto safety recall in history, as U.S. regulators consider whether to make it even wider. ,The 10 million inflator recall made public Wednesday covers inflators that were a temporary fix. The figure includes some inflators never installed. Several automakers have already initiated additional recalls to replace the recalled inflator with an alternative final part.  ,Separately, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) is assessing whether to compel the recall of tens of millions of additional Takata air bag inflators that have a drying agent. It is also reviewing petitions from General Motors Co (,) to avoid recalling more than 6 million vehicles with Takata inflators. ,GM has said it could cost $1.2 billion if it had to recall the vehicles. ,Prior to Wednesday, 41.6 million U.S. vehicles equipped with 56 million defective Takata air bags have been recalled because the inflators can explode when deployed. At least 25 deaths worldwide and more than 290 injuries have been linked to faulty Takata inflators. ,The Takata recalls cover about 100 million inflators among 19 major automakers worldwide. ,NHTSA says the cause of the inflator explosions that can emit deadly fragments is propellant breaking down after long-term exposure to high temperature fluctuations and humidity. The vehicle inflators recalled to date do not have a drying agent. ,Under a 2015 consent order, Takata had to provide data to U.S. regulators by Dec. 31 about whether tens of millions of additional so-called desiccated inflators need to be recalled. ,Acting NHTSA Administrator James Owens told Reuters the agency was reviewing data on the desiccated inflators and talking to automakers. ,""We are going to lean in on safety and if we detect a safety problem we will immediately take action,"" Owens said, adding that the agency could make a decision early in 2020. ,An independent group after five years of testing inflators told NHTSA in October there was ""no immediate safety risk"" to the inflators with a drying agent but added ""out of an abundance of caution, we recommend a well-designed monitoring program."" ,Owens said NHTSA may announce new monitoring.

"PARIS (Reuters) - Ex-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn said on Wednesday that a surprise corporate move, orchestrated five years ago by French President Emmanuel Macron who was then economy minister, soured relations between Renault and Nissan and contributed to his ouster. ,Ghosn, the former head of the car alliance, said Nissan executives and Japanese officials were shocked by a 2015 decision by the French government to increase its voting rights at Renault. ,""This left a big bitterness. Not only with the management of Nissan, but also the government of Japan,"" Ghosn told reporters, although he did not name Macron. ""And this is where the problem started."" ,Macron's office did not respond to a request for comment for this story. ,In April 2015, as a 37-year-old minister with then-unknown presidential ambitions, Macron ordered a rise in the state's stake in Renault , designed to secure double voting rights. ,The overnight move gave the French state a blocking minority in Renault, which in turn controlled Nissan via its 43.4 percent stake in the Japanese firm. ,According to French and Japanese sources, that rattled the Japanese side of the Renault-Nissan alliance, which feared a national champion was falling under the control of the French government.  ,In the ensuing eight-month boardroom fight between Macron's ministry and Hiroto Saikawa - Nissan's second-in-command at the time - Ghosn sees the seeds of the Franco-Lebanese executive's downfall. ,The 65-year-old fled Japan last month as he awaited trial on charges of under-reporting earnings, breach of trust and misappropriation of company funds, all of which he denies. ,He is now in Lebanon, where he spoke to international media on Wednesday. ,""There started to be some kind of defiance from our Japanese colleagues, not only about the alliance but also about me,"" Ghosn told a news briefing.  ,""And some of our Japanese friends thought: the only way to get rid of the influence of Renault on Nissan is to get rid of him,"" he added. ""Unfortunately, they were right."" ,He said that, partly because of the mistrust caused by the 2015 row, he had doubts about the future of the alliance.  ,Asked if he felt let down by the French government's muted response to his arrest, Ghosn replied: ""How would you have felt in my place? Supported? Defended? Let down? I don't know. I won't state a view for now. ,""I am a French citizen like any other. I'm not asking to be treated better than anyone else, but I shouldn't be treated less well than others either. ,""When the French president says 'presumed innocent', I believe him.

"PARIS (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn said on Wednesday he was the victim of a conspiracy to oust him from the helm of automaker Nissan and escaped from Japan because he could not defend himself against baseless charges of financial misconduct. ,Now in his childhood home of Lebanon, Ghosn, one of the world's most recognized corporate leaders, is out of the clutches of Japan's judiciary but is an international fugitive still subject to legal risks. ,Here are some of the risks: ,Interpol has issued an international arrest notice for Ghosn at Japan's request. Lebanese authorities have said they will take the necessary steps, without spelling out what that would involve. ,Lebanon does not have a formal extradition treaty with Japan. While Japan could still lodge an ad hoc request, Lebanon's laws prohibit the extradition of Lebanese nationals to foreign states. Ghosn has Lebanese, French and Brazilian nationality. ,Ghosn said he had received no assurances from the public prosecutor, who has summoned Ghosn for questioning on Thursday. ,The businessman is feted as a local hero in Lebanon and has links to the upper echelons of power. ,""Before political cover, he has Christian cover,"" said Mohanad Hage Ali, a fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center, noting that Ghosn's ancestry is Maronite, the most powerful of Lebanon's Christian communities. Extraditing a Maronite ""would be a very polarizing decision to make."" ,The Interpol Red Notice calls on authorities to arrest a wanted person but does not compel them to do so. Even so, the risk of detention abroad will be higher than if he remains in Lebanon, extradition lawyers said. ,""The upshot of that is there are a 194 countries that are members of Interpol and any of them, other than Lebanon and France, could either detain him automatically if he crossed their border or do so relatively quickly if they had some kind of extradition arrangement with Japan,"" said Nick Vamos of London law firm Peters & Peters, a former head of extradition at Britain's Crown Prosecution Service. ,Brazil also refuses to extradite its own citizens. ,After being held for half a year in an austere Japanese detention center before spending seven months under stringent bail conditions, which included not being allowed to see his wife, Ghosn said: ""I prefer this prison to the one before."" ,A senior Japanese justice ministry official acknowledged the likelihood of persuading Lebanon to hand Ghosn over was low. ,Ghosn could yet face trial in Lebanon if the government there refused an eventual extradition request from Japan and the Lebanese prosecutor determined that the Japanese charges he faced constituted a criminal offense locally. ,Tokyo could also try to seize assets belonging to Ghosn, Vamos said. ,""I left Japan because I wanted justice. It is the only way to reestablish my reputation. If I don't get it in Japan, I will get it somewhere else,"" Ghosn told a news briefing. ,A source close to Ghosn has said he wanted the charges to be brought against him in a Lebanese court, where his legal team believes it has a stronger chance of winning the case.  ,""It will be a long process,"" the source said. ,Ghosn's legal team, meanwhile, might argue for the lifting of the Interpol Red Notice, said Michael Drury, Head of Extradition at BCL Solicitors who counts opponents of Turkey's president among his clients. ,Ghosn would not be drawn on his next move. ,""I am used to what you call 'Mission Impossible',"" he said.

"(Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn, the ousted boss of the Renault-Nissan carmaking alliance who fled house arrest in Japan last week, denies the allegations of financial misconduct made against him.  ,Following are the court charges against Ghosn, his responses and counter-claims:  ,UNDER-REPORTED EARNINGS ,After arresting him in November 2018, Tokyo prosecutors the following month charged Ghosn and fellow board member Greg Kelly with conspiring to hide 5.2 billion yen ($48 million) in Ghosn's earnings over five years from 2010 in filings to the Tokyo Stock Exchange. In January last year, when Ghosn was still being held in Tokyo's main jail, prosecutors brought a second charge for allegedly under-reporting a further 4.1 billion yen in the subsequent three years.  ,Nissan, which has also been charged in connection to the under-reporting, declined to give further details about the allegations, but the Nikkei business daily, citing unidentified sources, said Ghosn had received share price-linked compensation of about 4 billion yen over a five-year period to March 2015 and it went unreported in Nissan's financial reports. ,The financial reports also did not mention annual compensation of 100 million to 150 million yen Ghosn received from the automaker's overseas subsidiaries, the newspaper said. ,In a statement made during his first court appearance, Ghosn said all earnings had been disclosed and that any deferred compensation due to him after retiring had been approved. In what he referred to as a ""death test"" he argued that none of his heirs would have received payments apart from his retirement allowance, meaning that it did not count as earnings. ,A third charge brought by prosecutors in January 2019 was for alleged breach of trust for transferring personal losses of 1.85 billion yen from investments in currency derivatives to Nissan in October 2008 in the midst of the financial crisis. ,The charge also alleges Ghosn authorized a total of $14.7 million in payments from a Nissan subsidiary to a company owned by another individual when the investments were transferred back to the asset management company between June 2009 and March 2012. ,Ghosn, in a court filing, said he invested in the financial instruments to avoid currency fluctuations because he was paid in yen rather than dollars. After his banks asked for more collateral, he said he asked Nissan to temporarily, and at no cost to the company, take on the currency swaps. His only other choice, he said, would have been to resign from the automaker in order to access his retirement allowance. ,The fourth charge brought by prosecutors in April 2019, alleged Ghosn illegally misappropriated $5 million from Nissan between July 2017 and July 2018.  ,They accuse the former Nissan chief of approving three payments totaling $15 million to a Nissan dealership, a portion of which was then transferred to a company controlled by Ghosn. ,In April, former Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa said a months-long internal investigation had also uncovered evidence that Ghosn used company funds for personal purposes and misrepresented the company's investments. ,Nissan said it had filed a criminal complaint against Ghosn in relation to the matter, saying it had determined that some of its overseas payments had been ordered by Ghosn for his personal enrichment. ,Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported Nissan paid billions of yen to buy and renovate homes for Ghosn in Rio de Janeiro, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam, citing unidentified  sources. The properties had no business purpose and were not listed as benefits in filings to the Tokyo bourse, it said. ,The Nikkei reported that Nissan - through a British Virgin Islands unit of a Dutch venture fund subsidiary - bought and renovated homes for Ghosn in Brazil and Lebanon worth around $18 million. Nissan, the report added, also paid several hundred thousand dollars for Ghosn's family vacations. ,The Yomiuri, Japan's biggest-circulation daily, said Nissan had been paying Ghosn's elder sister $100,000 a year since 2002 for a non-existent advisory role. She lived in a luxury Rio de Janeiro apartment funded by a Nissan subsidiary, according to the report, which cited unidentified sources.         ,In statements released through his lawyers in Japan and court filings seen by Reuters, Ghosn has denied any wrongdoing, saying that all payments were approved and above board. He asked the courts to dismiss the charges against him before fleeing to Lebanon. ,Ghosn says he was ousted as chairman of Nissan as part of a government-backed coup to destroy any possibility of a merger between Nissan and its French alliance partner Renault.  ,Ghosn's legal team also says prosecutors withheld evidence, citing concerns voiced by Nissan that it included sensitive information about operations and employees.

"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Former Nissan-Renault boss Carlos Ghosn said on Wednesday he had not initially paid to hold a family party in the grounds of the sumptuous Versailles Palace because he thought the palace was offering him the use of the venue for free. ,Ghosn, who last month escaped to Lebanon from Japan where he was on bail awaiting trial, is under a separate investigation in France to establish if the party at the 17th century palace was a financial benefit that he obtained improperly. ,Speaking at his first news conference since his November 2018 arrest in Japan, Ghosn said he had believed the use of the grounds of the opulent venue was a ""commercial gesture"" from the palace in return for Renault's sponsorship of renovations. ,Ghosn said he was later surprised to learn that the use in October 2016 of the Grand Trianon building, located in the grounds of Versailles Palace, was billed to Renault. ,""Catherine Pegard, who is the head of Versailles, told me 'Mr Ghosn you are a big benefactor, you know from time to time for our big friends we can make rooms available.

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Deere & Co.

Still, Deere expects industry sales of farm equipment in the United States and Canada, its biggest market, to decline about 5% this year. ,In response to weak demand, the company has cut production and laid off workers. ,May said Deere is reviewing its overseas manufacturing footprint in markets that have peaked or where it has over-invested. He did not provide the names of those facilities. ,The company is also carrying out a voluntary separation program for its salaried employees, now projected to result in savings of $120 million, lower than $150 million estimated earlier. ,May expects the cuts to add 1 percentage point to Deere's profits by 2022. ,The company is aiming to get a similar profit boost from investments in data-driven farming, known as precision agriculture, which enables farmers to plant according to the fertility of the soil, helping reduce input costs and enhance  yields. ,Similarly, it is betting on its parts and maintenance services business to contribute 50 basis points in added profits over the next two years.

"(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc on Wednesday informed its California customers that it would switch to providing estimates as opposed to fixed prices for its rides in response to a new law that makes it harder to qualify its drivers as contractors. ,In an email sent out to riders and seen by Reuters the company said the final price would now be calculated at the end of a trip, ""based on the actual time and distance traveled."" ,""Due to a new state law, we are making some changes to help ensure that Uber remains a dependable source of flexible work for California drivers,"" the company said in the email. ,The change applies to all private rides, while upfront prices will continue to be provided for shared, or pooled rides. ,The email included a picture displaying an example of a ride request on the Uber app. It showed a $27 to $36 range for an UberX ride, the company's most popular private ride option.  ,Uber in a blog post on Wednesday said the step was the result of changes to its fare structure, with drivers still getting paid per mile and minute, but the company now taking a fixed 25% cut from drivers. That service fee previously fluctuated. ,Uber on Wednesday also told customers it discontinued some of its reward benefits for frequent riders. ,The company hopes the changes will bolster its argument that Uber is merely a technology platform connecting riders with drivers, not a transportation company. ,The California law strikes at the heart of the ""gig economy"" business model by making it harder for companies to qualify their workers as contractors rather than employees. The measure went into effect on Jan 1. ,By classifying contractors as employees, technology companies like Uber, Lyft Inc, DoorDash and Postmates Inc would be subject to labor laws that require higher pay and other benefits, such as medical insurance. ,Uber and Postmates, a courier services provider, in a lawsuit in late December asked a U.S. court to block the law. ,Uber has repeatedly said that its drivers are properly classified as contractors.  ,Nevertheless, the company has made changes to its driver app in recent weeks, with California drivers now being able to see more information ahead of accepting a trip, including the ride's likely fare, length and destination.

"BEIRUT (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn, speaking publicly for the first time since his dramatic escape from Japanese justice, said on Wednesday he had been treated ""brutally"" by Tokyo prosecutors and was the victim of an inside job to oust him from the helm of automaker Nissan. ,The one-time titan of the car industry said in a two-hour news conference in Beirut that he had no choice but to flee. The alternative was to spend the rest of his life languishing in Japan without a fair trial. ,Ghosn, 65, fled Japan last month as he was awaiting trial on charges of under-reporting earnings, breach of trust and misappropriation of company funds, all of which he denies. ,""I felt like the hostage of a country I served for 17 years,"" he told reporters. ,In a combative performance, he gave a point-by-point rebuttal of the charges which he said he had been prevented from doing before, and compared the surprise of his arrest with Japan's preemptive strike on Pearl Harbour during World War Two. ,Ghosn said he had escaped to his childhood home of Lebanon to clear his name and declined to say how he fled, noting there were conflicting stories about his astonishing escape. ,""The charges against me are baseless,"" Ghosn said, and he repeated his allegation that Nissan and Japanese authorities colluded to oust him following a downturn in Nissan's fortunes and in revenge for French government interference in the carmaker's alliance with Renault. ,Tokyo prosecutors said his allegations of a conspiracy were false and that he had failed to justify his acts. ,""Defendant Ghosn's allegations completely ignore his own conduct and his one-sided criticism of the Japanese criminal justice system is totally unacceptable,"" the Tokyo prosecutor's office said after Ghosn spoke. ,The 14-month saga has shaken the global auto industry, jeopardized the Renault-Nissan alliance of which Ghosn was the mastermind and increased scrutiny of Japan's judicial system. ,Ghosn said he had no intention of merging Renault with Nissan as some in Japan feared, but wanted to put the firms under a holding company that would have maintained a balance between the French carmaker's push for a union and the Japanese company's desire to remain autonomous. ,He named Masakazu Toyoda, an independent director at Nissan and a special adviser to the Japanese Cabinet; Nissan's ex-auditor Hidetoshi Imazu; and the car company's former executive vice president Hitoshi Kawaguchi as the main architects of his downfall. ,Imazu, Kawaguchi and officials at Nissan could not immediately be reached for comment.  ,""First, if he (Ghosn) has anything to say, he should do that openly in court before he leaves Japan illegally. A conspiracy story without any evidence sounds like a joke,"" one person referred to by Ghosn told Reuters. ,Ghosn declined to name Japanese government officials he said took part in the alleged plot because he said he did not want to embarrass the Lebanese government, but added he did not think  the top level of the Japanese government was involved. ,Ghosn covered many subjects, talking about his Marie Antoinette-themed party at the Palace of Versailles in France and describing harsh confinement in Tokyo's main jail. ,""I was brutally taken from my work as I knew it, ripped from my family and my friends...It is impossible to express the depth of that deprivation,"" he said. ,""I was interrogated for up to eight hours a day without any lawyers present...'It will get worse for you if you don't just confess,' the prosecutor told me repeatedly."" ,Ghosn became most animated in describing how he thought the Nissan-Renault alliance had lost its way since his departure, saying it had fallen behind in investment in technology, profitability and market value and failed to seize opportunities such as a potential tie-up with Fiat-Chrysler. ,""How do you miss that? It's unbelievable,"" he said. ,Nissan has said an internal investigation found that Ghosn had engaged in personal use of company money and had under-reported his income in violation of Japanese law. ,Japan's Ministry of Justice has said it will try to find a way to bring Ghosn back from Lebanon, even though it has no extradition treaty with Japan. ,""I didn't escape because I was guilty, I escaped because I had zero chance for a free trial,"" he said, adding that he was prepared to stand trial in any of his three home countries, Lebanon, France or Brazil, none of which have extradition agreements with Japan. ,When asked if he had been given any assurances from Lebanese officials about not being extradited, he said: ""I am confident that the existing practices and laws will be respected in Lebanon and this is what I heard from all the officials here."" ,Lebanon's state news agency said a public prosecutor had summoned Ghosn for questioning on Thursday.  ,Ghosn said the Japanese authorities were intent on preventing him having his say. ,""Why have they spent 14 months trying to break my spirit, barring any contact with my wife?"" he said. ,Tokyo prosecutors issued an arrest warrant for Ghosn's wife, Carole, on Tuesday for alleged perjury related to the misappropriation charge against her husband. ,Turkish and Japanese authorities are investigating how Ghosn was smuggled out to Beirut. Interpol has issued a ""red notice"" seeking his arrest. ,""This (escape) was the most difficult decision of my life but I was facing a system where the conviction rate is 99.4 pct and I believe the number is far higher for foreigners,"" he said. ,""When I saw I was free it was as if I was born again.""

"BUDAPEST/WARSAW (Reuters) - Eastern Europe is a new frontier for private medical care, and insurers and tech startups are racing to steal a march on their rivals by harnessing the region's health data.   ,Growing numbers of people in Eastern European states, from Hungary and Poland to Romania, are turning to private health. The shift is being driven by rising wages, coupled with low public health spending which has often led to staff shortages and long waiting times for tests and surgery. ,Now big insurance players in the region, including PZU, Generali, Vienna Insurance Group (VIG) and Allianz, are looking to gather and analyze patient data from the fast-growing market to improve risk assessments and pricing. ,""Data is the foundation of the future,"" said Gabriella Almassy, general manager of VIG's Hungarian division, adding that data would be key to identifying where profits can me made in the region's increasingly competitive health insurance market. ,To that end, many insurers are teaming up with technology companies such as Polish startup Infermedica, whose software analyzes anonymized health information to provide preliminary diagnoses. ,""We are seeing a health data boom that resembles the financial data boom from 10-15 years ago when the banking sector changed a lot,"" said Maciej Malenda, head of partnerships at Infermedica, which works with PZU and Allianz. ,""Calling it a gold rush is perfectly accurate."" ,PZU, the region's biggest insurer, said it was also looking into dozens of other startups to help it expand its health business.  ,Health data is an increasingly coveted prize for insurers and technology companies globally.   ,The trend was illustrated by Google's plans to buy fitness-tracker maker Fitbit for $2.1 billion, announced late last year. The deal will bring the web giant a rich trove of data gathered by millions of Fitbit devices, which monitor users' daily steps, calories burned, heart rate and sleep quality, among other things.  ,Fitbit has already partnered with insurers, and analysts say much of its value may now lie in its health data.  ,The fledgling nature of the Eastern European private healthcare market presents rare opportunities, due to low market saturation compared with more mature Western markets, combined with rising consumer spending power - however it also poses the biggest obstacles for insurers. ,Executives say a scarcity of data can make it difficult, or unwise, to identify trends and complicates the pricing of risk. They stress that it could take several years before investments in data collection and analysis pay off, although they declined to disclose spending figures, citing commercial sensitivity. ,Attila Hevesi, a product development manager at Generali's Hungarian division, said there was no comparison between the quantity and quality of data available for health insurance and, for example, car insurance. ,""The two are not on the same page,"" he said. ""It is like a dolphin versus a blue whale. But maybe even a dolphin is an exaggeration."" ,In an illustration of the thinking of big insurers, Hevesi said Generali had struck a big health insurance deal with a large employer which could end up being loss-making, but it was willing to take the risk to build up its trove of patient data in the emerging Hungarian market. ,He declined to give details about that deal, but said Generali was incrementally improving its pricing in Hungary as a result of data-gathering. ,VIG's Czech division also said access to reliable health data was a problem. ,""Today, we are pricing based on clients' data used for life insurance,"" said Kooperativa board member Filip Kral. ,Another major challenge facing the nascent regional market is ensuring data privacy and security.  ,Companies handling personal data are required to protect confidentiality and need to put appropriate security measures in place to comply with stringent EU data protection rules. ,However the risks of handling sensitive health information were illustrated in October when Hungary's National Institute of Pharmacy and Nutrition was hacked, with the data of thousands of patients leaked from pharmacies and drug wholesalers. ,Elsewhere in Europe, a British hospital trust was rapped by privacy authorities two years ago for misusing data, after it passed on personal information of around 1.6 million patients to AI firm Google DeepMind.  ,Despite the potential pitfalls, however, many insurers looking to carve out a niche in Central and Eastern Europe's health market have little choice but to embrace data-gathering to improve pricing and profitability. ,VIG, for example, is planning to steer many Hungarian customers to a self-service online platform this year, which would give the company more granular data on how patients use private health services. ,In the first nine months of 2019, VIG's health insurance premium volumes rose to 513 million euros, with 62% of that coming from Austria and the rest from Central and Eastern Europe - but the group is banking on the latter to underpin its business in coming years, according to spokesman Wolfgang Haas.  ,""This is where we see the greatest potential for the future.""

"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Even as the United States and Iran appear to signal a keenness to avoid further conflict, oil and gas shipowners are bracing to pay a price for the war of words that culminated in rocket strikes in Iraq over the last week - higher insurance bills. ,According to industry sources, payments known as war risk premiums for tankers shuttling through the Strait of Hormuz could rise significantly, adding hundreds of thousands of dollars to shipping costs in some cases that will ultimately be passed on to fuel buyers - mostly in Asia. ,About 20% of the world's crude oil supply and a quarter of the global supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) are transported on tankers through the Strait of Hormuz, a narrow passage between the Gulf and the Indian Ocean. Saudi Arabia is the world's biggest crude oil exporter, while Qatar is the top LNG exporter. ,""We are obviously concerned with regard to the tension around the wider (Gulf) area,"" said Svein A Ringbakken, managing director of  Norwegian ship insurer Den Norske Krigsforsikring for Skib (DNK) told Reuters. ""Ships' transits in these areas have already for some time been subject to additional war risks insurance premiums which may increase in light of the recent developments.""  ,Ship owners pay annual war-risk insurance cover as well as an additional 'breach' premium when entering high-risk areas. These separate premiums are calculated according to the value of the ship, or hull, for a seven-day period. ,Ship insurers have quoted the breach rate for 7 days at around 0.35% of insurance costs, up from about 0.15% in December, a London-based shipbroker said.  ,One Singapore-based LNG shipbroker calculated the extra costs as significant. ""Depending on the type of ship, this adds about $150,000 to $200,000 (to overall costs) per trip."" ,Others in the shipping industry are less concerned about extra financial burdens, saying the current pricing of Gulf risks have already factored in the potential of another attack on merchant shipping and thus may not change - unless the situation worsens.  ,""For LNG markets, the escalating tensions in the Middle East mean all eyes will be on any risk to passage through the Strait of Hormuz,"" said Saul Kavonic, analyst with Credit Suisse.  ,""A prolonged closure of the Strait of Hormuz could see LNG spot prices skyrocket, and see a demand destruction scenario emerge turning the current soft LNG market on its head,"" he said.

"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's antitrust regulator is looking into allegations that Maruti Suzuki (,), the country's biggest car maker, pushes buyers to purchase insurance policies offered by the company, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. ,The Competition Commission of India (CCI) in June last year received an anonymous complaint alleging insurance plans recommended by Maruti while selling cars resulted in customers paying more compared with other options in the market. ,Based on the complaint, the CCI is assessing whether Maruti has engaged in so-called ""tie-in arrangements"", in which a car maker promotes preferred suppliers of complementary goods such as lubricants or insurance, the sources said. ,Indian law says such practices are anti-competitive if they end up stifling competition and limiting consumer choices. ,The Commission is looking into the complaint and ""it will take a while"", said one of the two sources, who declined to be named as the case details are private. ,In response to Reuters questions, a Maruti spokesman said: ""We are not aware of any such alleged complaint that is being investigated by CCI and therefore cannot comment on the same.""  ,The CCI did not respond to a request for comment. ,The watchdog can still throw the complaint out if it finds no merit in the allegation, or order a deeper probe by its investigations arm. ,Maruti is already the subject of another antitrust investigation in India. Last year, the CCI ordered its investigations unit to probe allegations the carmaker limits discounts its dealers can offer, a prohibited anti-competitive practice if it hurts consumers. [nL4N2452JM]  ,If the CCI decides to launch a wider probe into the new complaint, it could ask its investigation unit to wrap it into the ongoing case into Maruti's discounting practices, or order a fresh investigation, the second source said. ,It was not clear over what period the anonymous complaint about insurance sales relates to. ,Maruti, majority-owned by Japan's Suzuki Motor (,), is a market leader in India with a 50% share of the passenger vehicles market. It sold 1.73 million cars in the fiscal year ending March 2019 and has around 3,600 sales outlets. ,The allegation of insurance tie-up arrangements against Maruti is similar to an earlier complaint against its competitor, South Korean carmaker Hyundai Motor Co (,), a third source aware of the complaint told Reuters. ,In 2014, following a complaint from a car dealer, the CCI found initial merit in the allegations that Hyundai had entered into several tie-in arrangements, including to promote certain insurance companies, and ordered a wider investigation. ,However, in its final order in 2017, the CCI said Hyundai's insurance arrangements were not anti-competitive. ,""The most credible way for Maruti to show there is no tie-in would be by providing actual data on Maruti car buyers opting for insurers other than those recommended by it,"" said Rahul Rai, a New Delhi-based lawyer specializing in antitrust law.

" (This Jan. 8 story corrects para 11 to say private-label companies, and not retailers, will need to sell plant-based products at a net wholesale cost of $1.25 below Beyond Meat and rivals) ,By Richa Naidu ,CHICAGO (Reuters) - Cashing in on rising demand for imitation meat, major retailers including Kroger and Walmart recently began to carry Beyond Meat's (,) plant-based burgers and sausages. ,Now, several stores are creating similar products that will compete with Beyond Meat. ,Kroger Co (,), the biggest U.S. grocer, on Wednesday rolled out its own line of plant-based imitation meat burgers nationwide under its Simple Truth in-house brand. The retailer said its pea protein-based products would be sold at ""more affordable prices"" than competing brand-name imitation meat. A Kroger spokeswoman said a two-patty pack would sell at about $4.99 to loyalty-card-holding customers. ,German-owned discount supermarket Aldi U.S., which sells Meatless Meatballs and Chickenless patties, said it keeps its plant-based meat products at prices ranging from $3 to $4.  ,In comparison, a package of two Beyond Burgers sells for about $5.99 at some major big-box stores. ,Aldi, which plans to launch more products this year and is testing a meatless breakfast sausage, told Reuters that sales of its store-brand plant-based meats were up 300% last year.  ,""It wouldn't surprise me if it was up 300% again this year,"" Scott Patton, who co-heads corporate buying at Aldi, said. ""If a customer is going to purchase a competitor's plant-based product versus an Aldi one, ours will be significantly cheaper."" ,For years, major retailers including Target (,) and Walmart (,) have invested in their in-house brands, lining up contract manufacturers to produce private-label food ranging from macaroni-and-cheese to ice cream. ,As a result, companies including Kraft Heinz (,) have reported multi-quarter sales losses as they lose share to private-label brands. Grocers typically do not give own-brand products better shelf-space, preferring to compete with lower prices. ,Albertsons Co Inc, whose grocery store chains include Safeway and Jewel-Osco, told Reuters that it prices its imitation meat at 50 cents to a dollar cheaper than products sold by Beyond Meat or Maple Leaf Foods' Lightlife - another big plant-based meat maker. ,Private-label brands will need to sell plant-based products at a net wholesale cost that is about $1.25 lower than Beyond Meat and other rivals, private label consultant Jim Wisner of Wisner Marketing Group Inc said. ""Product, of course, needs to be equally good or better."" ,Vegan burgers made from beans and other ingredients have been around for decades, but Beyond Meat said its 10-year investment in making peas taste like meat won't be easy for grocers to replicate. The company's proprietary food technology helped it list in a splashy initial public offering - Beyond Meat is now valued at about $5 billion, with its share price having more than tripled from the IPO. ,""You can put something in the shape of a patty and put it on a shelf where we are, but the barriers to entry are low and the barriers to success are high,"" Beyond Meat Chairman Seth Goldman told Reuters in a recent interview. The company said it has rebuffed approaches by several U.S. grocers to create plant-based meat sold under their private-label banners. ""We've seen several retailers launch plant-based burgers that were private label and they just weren't ready."" ,A Kroger spokeswoman said the company's own-brand plant-based meat was developed by an in-house R&D team and produced by a third-party. ,""Really, the pivot-point for the whole industry was the Beyond Meat IPO,"" said Danny Goodman from Don Lee Farms, a food maker that has supplied a variety of products to top U.S. retailers over the years, including Kroger, Whole Foods and Albertsons. ""I think it made a lot of companies sit up and put more resources into working on my plant-based line."" ,Kroger shares were unchanged at $28.59 in premarket trading.

"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's justice minister launched a rare and forceful public takedown of auto executive-turned-fugitive Carlos Ghosn after he blasted the country's legal system as allowing him ""zero chance"" of a fair trial as he sought to justify his escape to Beirut. ,After his dramatic flight to Lebanon last month, Ghosn spoke in public for the first time on Wednesday, saying he had been treated ""brutally"" by Tokyo prosecutors. He said they questioned him for up to eight hours a day without a lawyer present and tried to extract a confession out of him. ,In an effort to undo Ghosn's attempt to sway public opinion in his favor, Justice Minister Masako Mori followed shortly with a statement, translated into English and French, and held a news conference after midnight and again around 9:30 a.m. on Thursday morning to defend Japan's justice system. ,""I decided to do this because defendant Ghosn was looking to justify his unlawful exit from Japan by propagating a false recognition of our justice system,"" she said at the second news conference. ,""I felt that we needed to respond immediately to broadcast a correct understanding to people around the world."" ,Ghosn, the former chief of Nissan Motor Co Ltd (,) and Renault SA (,), fled Japan last month as he was awaiting trial on charges of under-reporting earnings, breach of trust, and misappropriation of company funds, all of which he denies. ,Mori said Ghosn's escape from his trial in itself ""could constitute a crime"" that would not be tolerated in any country. ,""My impression in listening to him was that there were few statements that were backed by any real evidence,"" she said. ""If he wants to prove his innocence, he should face fair trial proceedings here,"" she added, stressing that the allegations against him concerned financial crimes in Japan. ,""That would be the mark of a first-class businessperson and good citizen."" ,Mori blasted Ghosn for violating his bail by fleeing the country ""without showing a passport and breaking international rules that everyone in the world follows"". ,""It was a breach of faith that can't be explained to our children,"" she said. ,The spotlight on Japan's justice system comes as Mori is set to host in April the United Nations' Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, held once every five years.  ,Defending authorities' jailing of Ghosn, Mori said that in Japan, a suspect can only be arrested with a warrant from the court upon review by a judge, unlike in some countries where detention is possible without a warrant.  ,She added that indictments were only made in Japan when there was ample evidence toward a conviction, saying criticism of Japan's 99% conviction rate was therefore unwarranted. ,Mori repeated that Japan would try to find a way to bring Ghosn back from Lebanon. Interpol has issued an international arrest notice at Japan's request, which Ghosn said his lawyers could fight.  ,Ghosn, for his part, said he was prepared to stand trial in any of his three home countries of Lebanon, France or Brazil, none of which have extradition agreements with Japan.

"LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Technology companies transformed smartphones and televisions into continuous fountains of revenue. Now, big tech wants to work with automakers to do the same thing for your car. ,With the widespread rollout of autonomous vehicles still years away, the two industries have converged on the idea of cars providing services and features delivered ""over the air"" - that is, over the same wireless data networks used by smart phones.  ,Those services - streaming video, vehicle performance upgrades, dashboard commerce - could answer a pressing need for automakers. They need to learn how to milk their hardware for revenue long after vehicles roll off dealers' lots. Tech companies see cars and the time people spend in them as a new frontier for growth.  ,Both auto and tech companies used the big CES technology show here this week to showcase their determination to make the vision of vehicles as connected revenue machines a reality. Cloud computing giants Amazon.com Inc (,) and Microsoft Corp (,) were in the forefront, chasing the opportunity to manage torrents of data flowing to and from connected vehicles. ,""It's absolutely huge,"" General Motors Co (,) President Mark Reuss said in December of the opportunities to generate revenue after a vehicle is sold by providing streamed services and over-the-air upgrades facilitated by GM's new high-capacity onboard electrical system.  ,The pivot comes at a time when global automakers are looking for fresh revenue sources as sales slow and as rising costs to comply with tougher emissions standards threaten profit margins. Shares of legacy automakers such as Ford Motor Co (,) and GM badly lagged broader market indexes in 2019. The contrast is Tesla Inc (,), whose market cap on Wednesday for the first time exceeded Ford and GM's combined market values. ,Tesla pioneered the model for charging for over-the-air upgrades, now asking customers to pay $6,000 to turn on the full self-driving option. ,Other automakers are eager to try their hand at turning cars into upgradeable, revenue-generating gadgets. ,Chinese carmaker Byton's new M-Byte sedan features a 48-inch screen as a dashboard, as well as a steering-wheel display and a digital tablet for passengers. When parked, the car can be an office, enabling video conference calls, or a roadside cinema. ,BMW (,) showed at its CES display a concept of its future interior with reclining lounge chairs and a windshield with augmented reality built in to annotate the road ahead. BMW executive Klaus Froehlich told Reuters the automaker is seeking approval from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to get U.S. approval for the seats, but could not say when they would appear in production. ,Tech companies and suppliers want to accelerate the transformation of vehicles into subscription bundle-ready machines by helping automakers sort out the tangle of computer chips that make most current vehicles difficult or impossible to upgrade over the air. ,The current crazy quilt of vehicle processors ""is not cost effective, and it's hard to get (vehicles) developed and launched so that everything works all the time,"" said Glen De Vos, chief technology officer of auto supplier Aptiv Plc (,). Aptiv's solution: A new Smart Vehicle Architecture that consolidates most computerized functions. ,Harman, a unit of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (,), is also pushing a similar digital platform to control the flow of data in and out of the car. A centralized system, said Chief Executive Dinesh Paliwal, would help protect the car against hackers, who would have only one way in rather than dozens. ,Harman, which supplies some of the technology that automakers including Tesla use to deliver the over-the-air upgrades, plans to sell its new vehicle computing brain with cybersecurity features built in - but some car buyers will have to pay to turn it on. ,Qualcomm Inc (,), which already provides the cellular modem chips that allow vehicles to connect to the internet, introduced a more comprehensive computing system that can manage in-vehicle entertainment and help the car drive itself. One element is a much easier way for automakers and their partners to deliver feature upgrades, such as unlocking a better sound system already built into the car. ,NXP Semiconductors (,) is working on a chip that would serve as a gateway between the car and the cloud, to help automakers cope with the massive amounts of data that sensors and digital cockpits will create. ,That data has to be stored and managed, and that's where cloud computing providers such as Amazon Web Services come in.

"BOSTON (Reuters) - Two years ago, investor William Ackman, who pushes corporations to perform better, took his own advice and laid out a plan for a comeback after years of losses. ,Over dinner at the New York Public Library, Ackman told investors in January 2018 that he was going back to basics by cutting staff, ending investor visits that were eating into his time, and hunkering down in the office to do research. ,Now, Ackman has the numbers to prove his strategy is working. ,The Pershing Square Holdings portfolio, the biggest at his Pershing Square Capital Management firm, returned a stunning 58.1% last year, making it one of the world's best performing hedge funds. It outpaced not only the benchmark S&P 500 stock index's 29% gain, but also the average activist hedge fund's 18.3% return, data from Hedge Fund Research shows. ,Ackman has said privately he was going activist on himself to resuscitate his 16-year-old firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, after suffering double-digit losses in 2015 and 2016 followed by smaller declines in 2017 and 2018. ,When Ackman next meets investors over dinner in February, he will be able to report that 2019 was his firm's best year ever. Assets stand at $7.4 billion and he will be able to charge performance fees again. ,Despite his undisputed bragging rights, investors say they see a more humbled Ackman, who is sticking with the back-to-basics theme. He is staying out of the limelight while methodically searching for his next bets from new offices overlooking the Hudson River. ,Ackman declined to comment. ,If there was any secret sauce to last year's gains, it included patiently waiting for changes that Ackman had pushed for, often behind the scenes, to pay off, investors said. ,Some big winners, including Chipotle Mexican Grill (,), which returned a whopping 72% over the last year with a new chief executive, have been in the fund for years. ,Engagement at Starbucks (,), bought in late 2018 and up 40% in the last year, was out of the public eye.

The money could be better invested elsewhere, Ackman said, after having privately mused that he previously had held on to soured bets in drug company Valeant Pharmaceuticals and Herbalife (,) for too long. ,To be sure, many activists who - like Ackman - had bet portfolio companies would climb, got a boost from a booming stock market. Other firms, like Elliott Management and Third Point, that pursue activist investments plus a range of other strategies, delivered gains in the single- or low double-digits, their investors said. ,It may be tough to repeat 2019 but Ackman has noted that Pershing Square has had five years of gains topping 36%.

"(Reuters) - U.S. central bank officials need to hold themselves accountable and boost communication of their strategy as they grapple with the challenge of preventing inflation - and inflation expectations - from falling too low, a senior Fed official said Thursday.  ,The goal is in sharp contrast to the obstacles experienced by previous generations, when policymakers battled inflation that was ""undesirably high,"" New York Federal Reserve President John Williams said Thursday according to remarks prepared for a Bank of England conference in London.   ,Interest rates are lower now than they were before the recession because of slow productivity growth, demographic changes and increased demand for safer assets, Williams said.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump to restructure the United States's top trade relationships have cost American companies $46 billion since February 2018, and U.S. exports of goods hit by retaliatory tariffs have fallen sharply, according to an analysis of Commerce Department data. ,The lion's share of the higher tariff costs, some $37.3 billion, stemmed from duties on imports from China, said Washington-based consultancy Trade Partnership Worldwide, which calculated cumulative tariff costs through November 2019, the latest data available. ,Exports of U.S. goods hit by retaliatory tariffs from China and other countries fell by 23% in the 12 months ended November, compared with 2017, before the tariffs began, the analysis showed. Even when retaliatory tariffs have ended, those exports haven't bounced back, said Trade Partnership Vice President Dan Anthony. , ,Seasonally adjusted U.S. Commerce data released on Tuesday showed the overall U.S. trade deficit narrowed to a more than three-year low in November.  ,The Trade Partnership uses raw, not seasonally adjusted, data, which is specific enough to match tariff codes to categories of goods, and then break it down by state. It conducted the analysis for Tariffs Hurt the Heartland, which includes a coalition of more than 150 business associations and the Farmers for Free Trade coalition. ,Two states that hold early primaries in the 2020 presidential election, Nevada and New Hampshire, saw their exports of goods facing retaliatory tariffs drop by nearly twice the national average, Anthony said. Nevada exports integrated circuits and New Hampshire produces computer and electronics products. ,Trump's trade policies have not been a key issue to date for Democrats seeking their party's nomination. ,China's Vice Premier Liu He is slated to sign a Phase 1 trade deal at the White House on Jan. 15 at the White House, China's commerce ministry said on Thursday.  ,As part of that deal, the United States will halve 15% tariffs imposed in September 2019 on $120 billion in Chinese goods, but 25% tariffs on $250 billion in Chinese goods applied earlier will remain in place. ,U.S. exports of goods subject to retaliatory tariffs in China were 26% lower in the 12 months ending November than in 2017, while exports of items not facing such tariffs were 10% higher than 2017 levels, Anthony said.  ,Total U.S. exports were higher than in 2017, but retaliatory tariffs slowed growth in 2018 and exports have declined in 2019, he said. ,Trump imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in February of 2018. U.S. exports to countries that retaliated with tariffs of their own were 15% below their 2017 levels in the 12 months ending November 2019, he said. ,After Washington rolled back these tariffs for Mexico and Canada, the two countries eliminated retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods in May, but U.S. exports of affected products have not rebounded.       ,""The expectation was that trade would start growing again, but that hasn't happened in the last six months,"" Anthony said.

"(Reuters) - Venezuelan state company PDVSA is letting some joint venture partners take over the day-to-day operation of oilfields as its own capacity dwindles due to sanctions and a lack of cash and staff, according to a former oil minister, an opposition lawmaker and industry sources. ,Crude production by PDVSA and its joint ventures has fallen to about a third of its peak 20 years ago. The steepest fall has occurred since military officials with no oil industry experience took over PDVSA's management in late 2017 and Washington imposed sanctions on the state-run company in early 2019 in a bid to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro. ,Maduro's government and the opposition last year discussed allowing partners in PDVSA-led joint ventures to operate the oilfields, which would reverse a legal requirement that PDVSA control the operations. ,That could give Maduro more breathing room by encouraging fresh investment in PDVSA's operations, potentially boosting oil revenues. However, it would be controversial after late President Hugo Chavez, an iconic figure to many Venezuelans, made nationalization a flagship policy. ,Rafael Ramirez, a former oil minister and PDVSA president who left office after clashing with Maduro in 2014, said the company had already effectively handed control to joint venture partners even though an agreement had not yet been formally reached.  ,Ramirez, an adviser to some international energy firms that have recently worked in Venezuela, said PDVSA had been reduced to little more than an administrator of contracts with oil companies.  ,""PDVSA is no longer producing. It's signing contracts for others to produce in a de facto privatization,"" Ramirez told Reuters during an interview at a location he requested not be disclosed.     ,Ramirez named Russia's Rosneft (,) and China's CNPC among the companies helping to keep PDVSA alive by operating joint oilfields or injecting cash to the state company by buying larger stakes in some ventures.     CNPC and Rosneft did not respond to requests for comment. PDVSA and the Information Ministry, which handles media requests for Maduro's government, did not respond to Reuters questions.   ,Luis Stefanelli, an opposition lawmaker and member of Congress' energy commission, said the government and PDVSA have been using formulas originally proposed by the opposition to allow private partners to take more responsibilities in joint ventures, but in an illegal way. ,Jose Ignacio Hernandez, an overseas legal representative appointed by Congress' head, Juan Guaido, backed up the comment. ,""Under the Hydrocarbon Law, every agreement for PDVSA to cede exploration and production rights is illegal and unconstitutional. Maduro's regime is insisting in the oil industry's de-facto privatization, which is aggravating its collapse,"" he said over Twitter.   ,Company executives, business partners and union leaders consulted by Reuters, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation, also said minority partners in some joint ventures progressively took more roles in 2019, including financing, trading, procurement and shipping. ,A CNPC executive, who recently visited the company's facilities in Venezuela, confirmed the efforts to transfer operation of some oilfields to minority partners but said it was a ""futile proposal.""  , ""Even if Caracas passes the new law to allow minority investors to become operators, companies can hardly do their job in reality,"" he said, added that lack of staff and widespread corruption were hobbling the industry. ,Ramirez was the longest-serving minister in Chavez's cabinet, supervising Venezuela's oil industry for more than a decade, before clashing with Maduro.  ,Maduro accuses him and many other former executives of corruption. Ramirez said he and other PDVSA executives are victims of a political witch hunt.   ,Ramirez said oil companies that signed partnerships or contracts with PDVSA without authorization from the National Assembly could see them annulled by any future government.  ,Venezuela produced 1.01 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude from January through November 2019, according to data reported to OPEC. Industry sources estimated it was at least 20% less.  ,Oil exports, Venezuela's main source of export revenue, fell  32% to an annual average of 956,000 barrels per day through November, according to Refinitiv Eikon.  ,Ramirez blamed the collapse on Maduro's decision to place the military in charge of PDVSA. ,After jailing two former PDVSA presidents on corruption charges, Maduro in 2017 appointed Manuel Quevedo, a major general from the National Guard with no experience in the energy sector, as PDVSA's head and oil minister.  ,That year, Maduro and Quevedo promised to add 1 million bpd to Venezuela's flagging output, but instead crude production and refining have slid to their lowest levels in almost 75 years. ,Ramirez said some 30,000 employees have left PDVSA in recent years, amid an exodus of experienced workers also described by union leaders and former staff.  ,""It's been a disaster,"" Ramirez said. ""The main processes in the industry - human resources, contracts, supply - are in the hands of military officials with no knowledge of oil.""

But the record European data further underscores the distance Boeing must travel to recoup its market position. ,Airbus, which had been forced by its own industrial problems to cut its 2019 delivery goal by 2-3% in October, deployed extra resources until hours before midnight to reach 863 aircraft for the year, compared with its revised target of 860 jets. ,Deliveries rose 7.9 % from 800 aircraft in 2018. ,Airbus declined to comment on the figures, which must be audited before they can be finalized and published. ,Planemakers receive most of their revenues when aircraft are delivered - minus accumulated progress payments - so the end-year delivery performance is closely monitored by investors.  ,Airbus's tally, which included around 640 single-aisle  aircraft, broke industry records after it diverted thousands of workers and canceled holidays to complete a buffer stock of semi-finished aircraft waiting to have their cabins adjusted. ,Airbus has been hit by delays in fitting the complex new layouts on A321neo jets assembled in Hamburg, Germany, resulting in dozens of these and other models being stored in hangars to await last-minute configurations and the arrival of more labor. ,Such out-of-sequence work drives up costs and could have a modest impact on Airbus profit margins, but the impact will be largely blunted by the high volume of planes and already solid profitability for such single-aisle aircraft, analysts say. ,Still, the problems in fitting complex cabins have curtailed Airbus's ability to take advantage of the market turmoil surrounding Boeing's 737 MAX - grounded since March following two fatal accidents. ,Boeing delivered 345 mainly long-haul jets between January and November, less than half the number of 704 achieved in the same period of 2018, when the MAX was being delivered normally. For the whole of 2018, Boeing had delivered 806 aircraft. ,Airbus production plants traditionally halt over Christmas and New Year. But the company's delivery centers and completion facilities were humming well into the afternoon of New Year's Eve to allow Asian and other airlines to fly away new jets.

Known for his authoritarian management style, he was at the helm of the German automaker from 2007 until his ouster in 2015. ,VW in September 2015 disclosed it had cheated on emissions tests for at least six years using secret software.

"(Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn, the ousted boss of the Renault-Nissan carmaking alliance who was awaiting trial in Japan, flew into Lebanon on Monday evening, France's Les Echos newspaper reported. ,It was unclear how Ghosn, who holds both French and Lebanese citizenship, would have been able to leave Japan, where he has been under strict court-imposed restrictions on his movements. ,Ghosn was being held in Tokyo's main detention center after allegations against him of financial misconduct.  ,The compensation packages for Ghosn, one of the most celebrated and well-paid leaders in the global auto industry, have been a sore point among investors of the Renault-Nissan alliance which he helped launch in 1999.   ,The scandal came after Ghosn narrowly won a shareholder vote at Renault over his 7.4 million euro pay package for 2017. He had lost the vote in 2016. ,The following are allegations made by Nissan and the media. There has been no public comment from Ghosn on the allegations, and Reuters could not contact him or his lawyers for comments. ,UNDER-REPORTED EARNINGS ,Japanese prosecutors allege Ghosn and fellow board member Greg Kelly, who is also being held for questioning, conspired to under-report by about half the 10 billion yen ($88 million) Ghosn earned at Nissan over five years from fiscal 2010 in filings to the Tokyo Stock Exchange. ,Nissan declined to give further details about the under-reporting, but the Nikkei business daily, citing unidentified sources, said Ghosn had received share price-linked compensation of about 4 billion yen over a five-year period to March 2015 and it went unreported in Nissan's financial reports. ,The financial reports also did not mention annual compensation of 100 million to 150 million yen Ghosn received from the automaker's overseas subsidiaries, the newspaper said. ,The Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the investigation, that Ghosn earned 8 billion yen in what Nissan calls unreported deferred compensation in the eight years that ended in March 2018. ,The structure was formulated in consultation with Kelly, and Ghosn told colleagues that if he was set to receive the deferred money after retirement, it wouldn't have to be reported in Japanese regulatory filings, the report said. ,The Asahi newspaper also reported, without citing sources, that Ghosn had understated his remuneration at Nissan by around 8 billion yen in the eight years through the fiscal year that ended in March, including 3 billion yen over the last three fiscal years. ,Nissan Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa has said that a months-long internal investigation had also uncovered evidence that Ghosn used company funds for personal purposes and misrepresented the company's investments. ,Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported Nissan paid billions of yen for the purchase and renovation of homes for Ghosn in Rio de Janeiro, Beirut, Paris and Amsterdam, citing unnamed sources. The properties had no business purpose and were not listed as benefits in filings to the Tokyo bourse, it said. ,The Nikkei reported that Nissan through a British Virgin Island unit of a Dutch venture fund subsidiary bought and renovated homes for Ghosn in Brazil and Lebanon worth around $18 million. ,Nissan, the report added, also paid several hundred thousand dollars for Ghosn's family vacations. ,The Yomiuri, Japan's biggest-circulation daily, said Nissan had been paying Ghosn's elder sister $100,000 a year since 2002 for a non-existent advisory role. She lived in a luxury Rio de Janeiro apartment funded by a Nissan subsidiary, according to the report, which cited unidentified sources.         ,Japanese media reported that Ghosn and Kelly have denied allegations against them, claiming that part of Ghosn's compensation had been put aside until he left the company and therefore was not subject to disclosure.  ,NHK said that Kelly told investigators that he had discussed the plan with other executives at Nissan.      ,Ghosn has yet to make any statement through his lawyers, while The Tokyo District Public Prosecutors remains tight-lipped about what they intend to do with the former Nissan chief and his colleague. ,French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire weighed in on Sunday saying he had yet to see evidence to support allegations of wrongdoing.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The 2010s was a lost decade for shares of U.S. energy companies overall. Volatile commodity prices amid growing supply, poor  financial performance and disfavor from some investor groups all contributed to the energy sector's transformation from investor darling to investor outcast. ,Graphic: ,     ,U.S. crude prices CLc1 fell more than 20% during the 2010s, while the rise of alternative energy also brought pressure, with some stock buyers shunning fossil fuel investments as socially irresponsible. ,But with the dawn of a new decade, some investors say the sun is also rising on energy shares. ,The energy sector's swoon defied a boom in U.S. domestic oil production, sparked by the advent of hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking."" Ten years ago, the United States was a net importer of about 10 million barrels per day of oil and fuels. It ends the decade poised to become a net exporter of oil and fuel products. ,""It really is a great irony that at a time when the United States became the world's biggest producer and has become a great exporter, that investors have become skeptical and have adopted a position of 'show me the money,'"" said Daniel Yergin, vice chairman of IHS Markit. ,""Industry is having to demonstrate that it can deliver those returns over several quarters, not just one quarter, so they're going through a real testing period right now,"" Yergin said. ,The S&P 500 energy sector .SPNY registered a meager 6% gain this decade, compared with a more than 180% rise for the benchmark S&P 500 stock index, according to Refinitiv data. ,Including dividends, the energy sector's total return rises to roughly 39%. But that pales in comparison to the S&P 500's over 250% total return and is only slightly above the roughly 37% return of the ICE BofA Merrill Lynch Treasury index .MERG0Q0, a barometer of U.S. Treasury bond performance. ,Over the past decade, including estimates for 2019, the energy sector's total earnings have declined 14.8%, while all other major sectors have seen growth of at least 28%, according to Refinitiv data. ,The energy sector's poor performance means its importance to the stock market has withered away. ,Energy represents less than 5% of the weight of the overall S&P 500, down from over 15% in mid 2008, when U.S. crude prices topped $140 a barrel, according to Refinitiv data. ,As a result, investors seeking overall stock market exposure require a smaller allocation of energy shares, another pressure point for the group. ,Even so, the decade was transformational for the oil-and-gas industry, which flocked to booming fields in west Texas and North Dakota. ,U.S. crude oil production, which was just over 5 million barrels per day (bpd) at the decade's outset, surged to a record 13 million bpd by the decade's end, leading to an abundance of supply that has pressured prices, while natural gas output also is setting records. ,""The price of energy has been lower than it would have been had none of this occurred,"" said Pearce Hammond, managing director at Simmons Energy in Houston. ,""It never benefited the energy companies,"" he added. ""Why? Because they outspent cash flow and they didn't deliver any kind of real returns. They were just huge sinks of capital."" ,But as 2020 arrives, some investors believe the energy sector will leave its struggles behind. ,""We have seen crude go to $60 and yet the energy stocks trade as if oil is at $40,"" said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager of Hodges Capital Management in Dallas. ,Investment advisory firm Alan B. Lancz & Associates is among those betting on energy shares. It is overweight the energy sector after buying shares of companies that include Exxon Mobil Corp (,), Chevron Corp (,) and Marathon Petroleum Corp (,), the firm's president, Alan Lancz, said. ,A ""perfect storm"" of macroeconomic factors pressured commodity prices - including the strong U.S. dollar and slowing economies in emerging markets - as well as more recently a fear of eventual increased U.S. regulations that has sparked more drilling, Lancz said. But he thinks both macro and political factors are poised to ease over the next year. ,""We see over a two-, three-year period a gradual recovery in this whole sector that has been unduly depressed,"" Lancz said.

"BEIJING (Reuters) - Japan's Nissan Motor Co has told its managers to slash non-essential spending as the automaker grapples with slumping car sales and tumbling profits, three company sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. ,The penny-pinching drive is in place for the rest of financial year until end-March and will most likely continue into the coming business year, they said.  ,Managers have been told to put the kibosh on unnecessary travel, sales incentives and promotional events to ""conserve every yen,"" as one source put it. ,Meetings that three or four people would once have traveled to attend in person, might now only have one Nissan representative, the sources said, while other gatherings and dinners have been canceled altogether or replaced by video-conferencing.The extensive spending cuts come in tandem with Nissan's decision this month to order a two-day furlough for U.S. employees Jan. 2-3. There is also an effective travel ban for staff in the United States, where sales have been particularly hard hit, one source said. ,While the automaker is not facing any cash crunch, the actions underscore a deepening sense of crisis at Nissan which has been rocked by the ouster of scandal-hit leader Carlos Ghosn, the departure of other top executives and strained relations with alliance partner Renault SA. ,In April, it embarked on a wide-ranging turnaround plan to revive sales and boost profits but the business outlook has worsened more than anticipated, the sources said. In November, it reported 70% slide in second-quarter operating profit and cut its full-year forecast to an 11-year low. ,The de facto freeze on non-essential spending is ""increasingly a modus operandi at Nissan globally,"" a second source said, adding: ""The house is not on fire, but there's something smoldering.""  ,The three sources declined to be identified as Nissan has not publicly disclosed the extent of the cuts. ,A Yokohama-based Nissan spokesman said: ""Given the business and operational situation we face, we're carrying out moves to cut expenses.""  ,The sources stressed that the automaker had sufficient cash resources. ,According to a fourth Nissan source, the automaker has good credit lines and plenty of cash, including money in China, which he said is years of accumulated profit from Nissan's China joint-venture operations. ,This week Nissan's stock hit lows not seen since September 2011 after Jun Seki, its vice chief operating officer and a former contender for CEO, said he was leaving the firm to become the president of Nidec Corp. ,On Friday, the automaker named executive officer Hideyuki  Sakamoto as a candidate for the board of directors following Seki's resignation.

"BEIJING (Reuters) - Profits at China's industrial firms grew at the fastest pace in eight months in November, but broad weakness in domestic demand remains a risk for company earnings next year.  ,China's industrial sector has faced persistent pressure in the past year, with manufacturers battling sluggish demand and a profit-denting trade dispute with the United States. But recent factory activity surveys have pointed to a nascent recovery in the manufacturing sector, following Beijing's accelerated stimulus measures to steady growth. ,Industrial profits in November rose 5.4% from a year earlier to 593.9 billion yuan ($84.93 billion), snapping three months of decline, as production and sales quickened, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Friday. That compared with a 9.9% drop in October. ,For January-November, industrial firms notched profits of 5.61 trillion yuan, down 2.1% from a year earlier, but slightly better than a 2.9% fall in the first 10 months.  ,The expansion was mostly due to quickening production and sales, while factory-gate prices contracted at a slower pace, said Zhu Hong, an official with the statistics bureau in a statement released alongside the data. ,But he cautioned that the rebound may not be an indication of a sustained recovery. ,""Although the profit growth turned to positive in November, we have to see that the current downward pressure on the economy is still big, and the volatility and uncertainty of profit growth still exist due to multiple factors such as market demand and industrial prices."" ,In November, profits at state-owned industrial firms rose 0.6% from a year earlier, reversing a declining trend since the second half this year, while private sector profits also posted a significant acceleration in growth.  ,Among sectors, the chemical, petroleum processing and steel industries reported recovering profits last month due to rebounding market demand and rising prices.  ,""We expect the surge in industrial profit growth to be just short-lived, given strong growth headwinds and still-elevated uncertainty amid U.S.-China trade tensions,"" analysts at Nomura said in a report after the data. ,""In our view, Beijing will likely continue to roll out moderate easing measures amid limited policy room."" ,The upbeat figures come amid patchy recoveries in industrial output against broad weakness in demand at home and abroad. ,Industrial production rose at the fastest clip in five months in November amid easing trade hostilities with Washington, but exports continued to hover in the contractionary zone. ,China and the United States cooled their 17-month long trade war earlier this month, announcing a Phase 1 agreement that would reduce some U.S. tariffs in exchange for more Chinese purchases of American farm products. ,Analysts said the deal could boost China's export activity and corporate investment in the near term, but its economic outlook would continue to be challenged by lackluster global growth.  ,U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he and Chinese President Xi Jinping will have a ceremony to sign the first phase trade deal agreed to this month. ,China's economy is expanding at the slowest pace in nearly 30 years and could face greater downward pressure next year, but policymakers have vowed more support to stabilize growth and prevent risks. ,The vast industrial sector shed more than 25 million jobs from end-2013 to end-2018, mostly in labor intensive industries, according to the latest economic census, as labor costs rose amid the country's economic transition.  ,China plans to set a lower economic growth target of around 6% in 2020, relying on increased state infrastructure spending to ward off a sharper slowdown, policy sources said. ,Beijing will study implementing more measures including broad-based and ""targeted"" cuts in banks' reserve requirement ratio (RRR) and raising relending and rediscount quotas to help lower financing costs for smaller firms. ,Liabilities at industrial firms rose 5.3% on-year at end-November, compared with a 4.9% increase as of end-October.

"NEW YORK/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Oil prices rose more than 20% this year but there were no sharp spikes and crude futures barely sniffed $70 a barrel despite attacks on the world's biggest oil producer, sanctions that crippled crude exports of two OPEC members and gigantic supply cuts from big oil producing countries. ,The price gains in crude oil benchmarks were all in the first quarter of 2019, even as the next several months featured supply shocks that in the past would probably have propelled crude past the $100 mark. ,Prices are likely to remain rangebound in 2020 as swelling supplies, particularly from the United States, offset cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and weakening worldwide demand, brokers and analysts said.  ,U.S. crude oil CLc1 is on track to end 2019 roughly 35% higher.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - What do you do when daily stock market gyrations all but dry up? Apparently, trade volatility like never before. ,Among the myriad Wall Street legacies of the soon-ending 2010s has been the emergence of market volatility - or the magnitude of security price swings over short time spans - as an asset class unto itself. It is all the more notable against the backdrop of the decade's fairly persistent market calm. ,The Cboe Volatility Index .VIX - nicknamed as 'Wall Street's fear index,' - is on track to end the decade at a level about a third lower than its lifetime average, according to Refinitiv data. With the S&P 500 Index nearly tripling since the end of 2009, the average level of the VIX this decade is the lowest of the three since it launched in the early 90s, even with a number of periodic spikes higher. ,Nonetheless, trading volatility, or ""vol"" in Wall Street parlance, came of age in a big way in the '10s. ,While vol has been around for as long as markets have existed, as an asset class it had remained out of reach of the average investor. That changed over the last two decades.  ,The launch of futures and options on the VIX in the mid-2000s led the way for the rollout of sophisticated exchange traded products (ETPs) near the end of that decade and provided everyday investors the first chance to trade vol on its own. ,A small legion of volatility-linked ETPs followed over the next 10 years. ,Some allowed investors to bet on stock gyrations rising, while others let traders bet on the opposite outcome. ,With the launch of these ETPs, trading in volatility was no longer limited to the futures and options market, where it all began. Investors could finally place bets on volatility as easily as trading stocks.  ,Investors plowed billions of dollars into both long and short volatility ETPs, with assets of select leveraged and inverse volatility ETPs hitting about $4 billion by the end of 2017. Assets in top volatility-linked ETPs now stand at about $3 billion. ,Graphic: VIX futures & ETPs , ,While most of these products started out being used by institutional players as hedges, an extended period of stock market calm in 2016-2017 boosted the returns for some short volatility ETPs, including the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term ETN XIV, attracting ever more speculative players. ,Yield-starved investors had stumbled upon what looked like the proverbial free lunch.  ,In an environment where the VIX plunged to new lows, buying short volatility ETPs reaped gold.  ,Volatility selling became such a rage that analysts warned that the trade was creating a feedback loop where the more investors sold volatility the lower it slipped. ,That is until a sudden drop in the U.S. stock market in February 2018 wiped out most of the value of these ETPs and led to the collapse of some products, including XIV. ,As the decade ends, the volatility ETP landscape looks much more stable than it did in 2016-2017, even as interest in trading volatility looks here to stay. ,Graphic: S&P 500 volatility by decade , ",Business News,12/30/2019 6:07,The decade that saw volatility trading come of age
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Whatever nickname ultimately gets attached to the now-ending Twenty-tens, on Wall Street and across Corporate America it arguably should be tagged as the ""Decade of Debt."" ,With interest rates locked in at rock-bottom levels courtesy of the Federal Reserve's easy-money policy after the financial crisis, companies found it cheaper than ever to tap the corporate bond market to load up on cash. ,Bond issuance by American companies topped $1 trillion in each year of the decade that began on Jan. 1, 2010, and ends on Tuesday at midnight, an unmatched run, according to SIFMA, the securities industry trade group.  ,In all, corporate bond debt outstanding rocketed more than 50% and will soon top $10 trillion, versus about $6 trillion at the end of the previous decade. The largest U.S. companies - those in the S&P 500 Index , - account for roughly 70% of that, nearly $7 trillion. ,Graphic: Long-term debt for S&P 500 , ,What did they do with all that money? ,It's a truism in corporate finance that cash needs to be either ""earning or returning"" - that is, being put to use growing the business or getting sent back to shareholders. ,As it happens, American companies did a lot more returning than earning with their cash during the 'Tens. ,In the first year of the decade, companies spent roughly $60 billion more on dividends and buying back their own shares than on new facilities, equipment and technology. By last year that gap had mushroomed to more than $600 billion, and the gap in 2019 could be just as large, especially given the constraint on capital spending from the trade war. ,The buy-back boom is credited with helping to fuel a decade-long bull market in U.S. equities.      ,Graphic: S&P 500 shareholder payouts , ,Meanwhile, capital expenditure growth has been choppy at best over 10 years. This is despite a massive fiscal stimulus package by the Trump administration, marked by the reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, that it had predicted would boost business spending. ,Graphic: Capital expenditure of S&P 500 , ,One byproduct of stock buy-backs is they make companies look more profitable by Wall Street's favorite performance metric - earnings per share - than they would otherwise appear to be. ,With companies purchasing more and more of their own stock, S&P 500 EPS has roughly doubled in 10 years. Meanwhile net profit has risen by half that, and far more erratically. ,Graphic: S&P 500 earnings per share , ,Graphic: Reported earnings for S&P 500 , ,The corporate bond market has not only gotten bigger, it has gotten riskier. ,With investors clamoring for yield in a low-rate world, debt rated only a notch or two above high-yield - or junk - bond levels now accounts for more than half of the investment-grade market, versus around a third at the dawn of the decade. ,Graphic: BBB/Baa issuance spikes , ",Business News,12/30/2019 6:19,"The Decade of Debt: big deals, bigger risk"
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. retailers including Walmart Inc will add ""Do Not Sell My Info"" links to their websites and signage in stores starting Jan. 1, allowing California shoppers to understand for the first time what personal and other data the retailers collect, sources said. ,Others like Home Depot will allow shoppers not just in California but around the country to access such information online. At its California stores, Home Depot will add signs, offer QR codes so shoppers can look up information using their mobile devices and train store employees to answer questions. ,Large U.S retailers are rushing to comply with a new law, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which becomes effective at the start of 2020 and is one of the most significant regulations overseeing the data collection practices of U.S. companies. It lets shoppers opt out of allowing retailers and other companies to sell personal data to third parties. ,In addition to retailers, the law affects a broad swath of firms including social media platforms such as Facebook and Alphabet's Google, advertisers, app developers, mobile service providers and streaming TV services, and is likely to overhaul the way companies benefit from the use of personal information.     ,The law follows Europe's controversial General Data Protection Regulation, which set a new standard for how companies collect, store and use personal data. The European law gave companies years to comply while CCPA has given them a few months. ,Draft regulations around the law were released in October. Retailers did not anticipate having to add signs in their stores, which are required by the regulations but were not part of the original statute. Requiring signs in stores is not an effective use of retailers' dollars, said Nicholas Ahrens, a vice president at the Retail Industry Leaders Association, who leads its tech policy. ,A Walmart source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters the company is ""working through a lot of ambiguities in the law, for example, the language around loyalty programs and if retail companies can offer them going forward."" ,There is also lack of clarity on what constitutes ""sale"" of information, retail lobbyists and attorneys advising retailers  said. ,Walmart spokesman Dan Toporek said the retailer supports efforts that gives customers control of their information.   ,Home Depot spokeswoman Sara Gorman said the California law introduces new requirements but does not change the company's ""deliberate approach to customer data and privacy."" ,Target spokeswoman Jessica Carlson said a ""Do Not Sell"" button on its website, will be visible to all U.S. shoppers and California residents will have access to information outlined under the new law. Target already allows its shoppers to opt out of sharing their information with third parties for marketing purposes, she said. ,Amazon.com Inc is taking a different approach. ""We do not plan to put a 'Do not sell' button on our website because Amazon is not in the business of selling customers' personal data and it never has been,"" a company spokeswoman said in a statement. ,Amazon will launch a revised privacy notice and will review the final regulations to ""understand what signage may be required to inform customers how to find the privacy notice"" at its stores, the spokeswoman added. ,Some national chains such as Sherwin-Williams, which sells paints and coatings,  have already begun adding links on their websites in California, Reuters has found. The company did not respond to requests for comment. ,Both Walmart and Amazon have ramped up investments in drawing out ""data maps"" in the past few months, which lets them collate the extent of personal information collected by different business units, where and how this information is stored, what they do with it and who it is shared with, sources said. ,A Walmart source said the company's different business teams including technology, marketing, advertising, payments and  security are investing resources in auditing and making decisions on how to respond to requests from customers to see their data or those who ask for it to be deleted. ,An economic impact assessment prepared for the California Attorney General's  office by an independent research firm found compliance with the regulations will cost businesses between $467 million and $16.5 billion between 2020 and 2030. Industry estimates peg initial compliance costs at over $50 billion. ,The California Attorney General recently told Reuters in an interview that privacy law enforcement will look kindly on those that demonstrate an effort to comply. ,But sources told Reuters they expect plaintiff attorneys to bring lawsuits in the new year against a range of businesses that may fail to meet the law's requirements. ,Many companies affected by the law have lobbied extensively for a federal privacy bill that might override the law in California. But their efforts have so far made little progress.  ,(This story has been refiled to add missing quotation mark in paragraph 12)     ",Technology News,12/30/2019 12:12,'Do Not Sell My Info': U.S. retailers rush to comply with California privacy law
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The dollar slid on Monday, and global stock markets fell as a year-end rally lost steam after pushing stocks to record highs in 2019. ,As investors assessed the outlook for next year, thin year-end trading volumes exacerbated broad weakness in the dollar, which has fallen the past three sessions.

"(Reuters) - The 2010s saw the U.S. economy achieve its longest-ever expansion, with notable milestones such as 110 months of uninterrupted job gains and an unemployment rate near a half-century low becoming easy bragging points for politicians and economists alike. ,Yet the obvious data points don't capture a number of the socio-economic developments - from a soaring number of opioid overdose deaths to record levels of student debt to what and where today's jobs are. These developments are subtle but they are profoundly shaping the economy and the discourse about it, as the '20s come into view. ,GRAPHIC: A workforce scarred - ,  ,The number of overdose deaths involving opioids doubled in the 2010s and appears to have hit a peak in 2017 at 47,600, which accounted for 68% of all fatal drug overdoses that year, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. On top of that, more than 10 million Americans over the age of 12 were found to have misused opioids in 2018, the last year figures were available from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. ,Long recognized as a nationwide health and social crisis, the opioid epidemic has become a growing focus for economists concerned it may be one of the factors behind the decade's slump in labor force participation among prime-age workers 25-54 years old. While improving since late 2015, participation remains below levels seen in the 1990s.	 ,GRAPHIC: The rich got (a lot) richer - ,  ,A soaring stock market and strong job growth have helped make Americans on the whole wealthier than ever, with total household net worth topping $107 trillion versus less than $60 trillion at the dawn of the decade.  ,But those gains have not be shared evenly. The richest 1% of households account for 32.4% of all wealth, up roughly 4 percentage points from the end of 2009. ,The phenomenon is feeding the national political debate, and some Democratic presidential contenders are now pushing for a national wealth tax. ,GRAPHIC: Job growth concentrated in a handful of cities - ,  ,Just as wealth is increasingly harnessed by a few, job opportunities are also concentrated in a handful of places around the country. ,Between 2010 and 2017, 40% of all new jobs were created in just 20 cities, with places like Nashville and Portland, Oregon, punching significantly above their relative population weight. ,GRAPHIC: Winners keep winning - ,  ,What's more, an even smaller clutch of five cities - four on the West Coast and one in the East - are gaining effectively all of the new jobs in so-called ""innovation"" industries seen as essential to future economic success. ,GRAPHIC: Jobs of the 2010s - ,  ,What Americans do for a living has changed a lot in the last 10 years. ,Many old-school industries saw minimal job growth, like manufacturing, or extended declines, like department stores. ,The evolving needs of an increasingly technology-oriented economy drove rapid growth in many IT jobs, while an aging population was behind a surge in the number of home health workers. Americans' changing spending habits - increasingly on experiences over things - helped make fitness center jobs among the fastest growing of the decade. ,GRAPHIC: American dream comes later and later - ,  ,Buying their first home used to be a milestone that many Americans achieved by the time they were 30. ,But a shortage of homes for sale is driving up prices and making it harder for younger consumers to break into the market, said Jessica Lautz, vice president of demographics and behavioral insights at the National Association of Realtors. ,Student debt loads are also making it more difficult for some borrowers to set aside sufficient cash for a down payment, or to qualify for a mortgage, she said. That helps to explain why the median age of the first-time home buyer ticked up to 33 in 2019 from 30 in 2010, according to the association.  ,GRAPHIC: Paying the higher education tab - ,  ,In fact, no category of consumer debt grew as fast in the 2010s as student loans, and serious delinquency rates are more than 10 times higher than for mortgages. ,Total balances owed to pay for higher education more than doubled since 2009 to around $1.5 trillion today - equal to nearly 8% of annual U.S. economic output. Nearly 11% of the total outstanding is 90 days or more behind in payments. ,Economists and politicians worry it is delaying or crowding out more productive spending, and some fear it may prove to be the ""debt bubble"" of the future.

"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies on Tuesday said its full-year revenue would likely jump 18% in 2019 to 850 billion yuan ($121.72 billion), lower than its earlier projections, as a U.S. trade blacklisting curbed growth and disrupted its ability to source key parts.  ,The world's biggest maker of telecom network equipment and the No. 2 manufacturer of smartphones, was all but banned by the United States in May from doing business with U.S. companies,  preventing its access to technology like Google's (,) Android operating system.  ,The U.S. government alleges Huawei equipment pose national security risks because they could be used by the Chinese government to spy on users. Huawei has repeatedly denied its products are a security threat. ,Huawei's Rotating Chairman Eric Xu revealed the numbers in a New Year's message to employees and customers in which he also forecasted 2020 to be a ""difficult year', saying that the firm was unlikely to grow as rapidly as it did in the first half of this year.  ,Its estimate of 18% revenue growth in 2019 is less than 2018, when Huawei's annual revenue rose 19.5%. ,The company did not break down fourth-quarter figures but according to Reuters calculations based on its previous statements, revenue in the quarter to end Dec. 31 rose to 239.2 billion yuan ($23.28 billion), up 3.9% from a year earlier and slower than the 27% increase it reported in the third quarter.  ,""The external environment is becoming more complicated than ever, and downward pressure on the global economy has intensified,"" he said. ,""In the long term, the US government will continue to suppress the development of leading technology – a challenging environment for Huawei to survive and thrive."" ,Xu also said that Huawei shipped 240 million smartphones this year, a 20% increase from 2018. Huawei has mainly sold smartphones that were launched before the ban. ,The newest Mate 30 smartphone first went on sale in September but it cannot access a licensed version of Google's Android operating system because of the trade curbs.  ,Xu said in his letter that Huawei would in 2020 ""go all out"" to build its Huawei Mobile Services ecosystem, which comprises services such as cloud storage and an app gallery, describing it as ""the foundation of our ability to sell smart devices in markets outside China"".  ,It is also developing its own mobile operating system known as Harmony, although analysts are skeptical that the system is a viable alternative. ,Huawei's reputation was dented earlier this month after details of the dismissal and wrongful detention of a former employee went viral. ,In his letter, Xu said they would continue to remove mediocre managers and complacent employees as Huawei needed to rid the company of complacency, and that they would remove managers performing in the bottom 10% every year.

"PARIS/HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Tencent-led consortium is taking a 10% stake in Vivendi's Universal Music Group, valuing the music label that houses Lady Gaga and The Beatles at 30 billion euros ($34 billion) and giving the Chinese firm a global backstage pass. ,The deal allows both companies to expand in a recovering global music market, giving Tencent more access to U.S. artists while UMG can tap into the Asian market, including big-selling ""K-Pop"" Korean pop stars. ,After months of talks, French media conglomerate Vivendi (,) said on Tuesday it had finalised the sale of an initial 10% of the world's largest music label to the Tencent consortium, which also had the option to buy up to 10% more by January 2021 on the same price basis. ,Vivendi, controlled by French billionaire Vincent Bollore, is seeking to cash in on the music industry's revival, driven by a growing subscription and ad-based music streaming services and the deal gives UMG an enterprise value of 30 billion euros. ,The initial deal would soon be followed by a second one allowing Tencent Music Entertainment (,) to buy a minority stake in UMG's greater China subsidiary. ,Tencent did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Vivendi did not disclose the details of the consortium beyond saying they were ""global financial investors"". ,Singapore's state investment firm GIC and Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) were also involved, a source familiar with the deal told Reuters. QIA declined to comment and GIC did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ,The IFPI federation said in April that global recorded music revenues had risen 9.7% in 2019 from last year, while Universal was Vivendi's main third quarter sales growth driver, with revenues rising nearly 16% to 1.8 billion euros. ,""Universal has been enjoying increased revenues for the last 5 years. With the company in a strong position, it can make sense to capitalise on the valuation with a minority sale at this point in the growth cycle,"" said MB Capital director Marcus Bullus, commenting on the deal. ,The tie-up between Tencent and Vivendi builds on a partnership struck two years ago, allowing Tencent to license Universal's music for distribution over its streaming platforms. ,Vivendi said in July last year it might sell up to half of UMG and any cash raised from a divestment could help finance a share buyback or acquisitions. ,The transaction should also boost morale among Chinese deal-makers, with China-outbound mergers and acquisitions (M&A) activity plunging to a 10-year low amid trade tensions between the United States and China, Refinitiv data shows. ,In November, Tencent Music Entertainment Group reported better-than-expected third-quarter revenue. ,Although Tencent Music's user base is nearly three times that of Spotify (,), which is the world's largest music streaming service, its paying users are comparatively fewer. ,Spotify, in which the Tencent Holding company (,) itself has a minority stake, had more than 100 million paid subscribers, whereas Tencent Music had about 35 million as of the third quarter.   ,Vivendi shares closed up 0.3%, with the final sale terms in line with earlier guidance from Vivendi. ,MB Capital's Bullus said it was unclear how Vivendi would use the cash and ""how this will increase value for existing shareholders now potentially left with cash in their pocket but a smaller stake in a growing cash generating company"". ,($1 = 0.8925 euros)  ",Business News,12/31/2019 8:21,Tencent gets into global groove with stake in Vivendi's Universal

"BEIRUT/TOKYO (Reuters) - Ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn said on Tuesday he had fled to Lebanon to escape a ""rigged"" justice system in Japan, raising questions about how one of the world's most-recognized executives had slipped away while on bail. ,Ghosn's abrupt departure marks the latest twist in a year-old saga that has shaken the global auto industry, jeopardised the alliance of Nissan Motor Co Ltd and top shareholder Renault SA and increased scrutiny of Japan's judicial system. ,""I am now in Lebanon and will no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system where guilt is presumed, discrimination is rampant, and basic human rights are denied,"" Ghosn, 65, said in a brief statement on Tuesday. ,""I have not fled justice - I have escaped injustice and political persecution. I can now finally communicate freely with the media, and look forward to starting next week."" ,Tokyo officials have previously said the system is not inhumane and that Ghosn, who is facing trial on financial misconduct charges he denies, has been treated like any other suspect. ,It was unclear how Ghosn, who holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese citizenship, was able to orchestrate his departure from Japan. He had been under strict surveillance by authorities while out on bail and had surrendered his passports. ,According to a senior Lebanese foreign ministry source, Ghosn entered Lebanon legally on a French passport and using his Lebanese ID with normal security procedures. People familiar with the matter told Reuters he had arrived in Beirut on a private jet from Istanbul on Monday. ,The French and Lebanese foreign ministries both said they were unaware of the circumstances of his journey. ""All discussion of it is his private matter,"" the Lebanese ministry added. ,Lebanon's state security directorate said Ghosn will not face any legal consequences for the way he entered the country, state NNA news agency reported. The foreign ministry said Lebanon did not have a judicial cooperation agreement with Japan. ,Japanese authorities had no record of Ghosn leaving, Japanese public broadcaster NHK said. A person resembling him entered Beirut international airport under a different name, NHK reported, citing an unidentified Lebanese security official. ,His lawyers were still in possession of his three passports, one of his lawyers, Junichiro Hironaka, told reporters. ,Hironaka, in comments broadcast live on NHK, said the first he had heard of Ghosn's departure was on the news this morning and that he was surprised. He also said it was ""inexcusable behaviour"". ,Japan has extradition treaties with only the United States and South Korea, according to the justice ministry, meaning it could be difficult to force Ghosn to return to stand trial. ,While his arrest on financial misconduct charges last year ensured a dramatic fall from grace in Japan, he retains more popularity in Lebanon, where billboards saying ""We are all Carlos Ghosn"" were erected in his support and he was previously featured on a postage stamp. ,Born in Brazil of Lebanese ancestry, Ghosn grew up in Beirut and has retained close ties to Lebanon. ,At Ghosn's gated villa in the Achrafieh neighborhood of Beirut, a handful of police and private security personnel stood guard on Tuesday.  ,A man who identified himself only as his English neighbor walked by to leave a card, with the words ""Carlos, welcome home!"" written inside. It was not immediately clear if Ghosn was at the address.  ,""It's a good thing that at last he's out of being locked up for something which he may or may not — probably not — have done,"" said the neighbor. ,A French minister said before the report Ghosn used a French passport that she was ""very surprised"" by news of his emergence in Lebanon. ,Ghosn was first arrested in Tokyo in November 2018, shortly after his private jet touched down at the airport. He faces four charges - which he denies - including hiding income and enriching himself through payments to dealerships in the Middle East. ,Nissan sacked him as chairman saying internal investigations revealed misconduct including understating his salary while he was its chief executive, and transferring $5 million of Nissan funds to an account in which he had an interest. ,The case sparked international criticism of Japan's justice system, in which 99.9 percent of people charged with crimes are convicted and defence lawyers are prohibited from being present during interrogations that can last eight hours a day. ,Ghosn was initially released in March on a record $9 million bail only to be arrested on related charges weeks later and then released on bail again at the end of April. ,His movement and communications have been monitored and restricted to prevent his fleeing the country and tampering with evidence, the Tokyo District court previously said. ,The terms of his bail have also been striking by Western standards. He has been prevented from communicating with his wife, Carole, and had his use of the internet and other communications curtailed. ,Carole is now with him in Lebanon at a house with armed guards outside, the New York Times reported, citing a person familiar with the matter.  ,Ghosn did not believe he would get a fair trial in Japan and was ""tired of being an industrial political hostage"", one person told The Wall Street Journal.  ,A person familiar with Nissan's thinking told Reuters: ""I think he gave up fighting the prosecutors in court."" ,The trial was widely expected to start in April. Ghosn's Japanese lawyers have fought, so far unsuccessfully, to get access to 6,000 pieces of evidence collected from Nissan, which they say is crucial to a fair trial.  ,Ghosn has said he is the victim of a boardroom coup, accusing former Nissan colleagues of ""backstabbing"" and describing them as selfish rivals bent on derailing closer ties between the Japanese automaker and its biggest shareholder Renault, of which Ghosn was also chairman. ,His lawyers have asked the court to dismiss all charges, accusing prosecutors of colluding with government officials and Nissan executives to oust him to block any takeover by Renault. ,Ghosn began his career in 1978 at tyre maker Michelin. In 1996, he moved to Renault where he oversaw a turnaround that won him the nickname ""Le Cost Killer."" ,After Renault sealed an alliance with Nissan in 1999, Ghosn used similar methods to revive the ailing brand, leading to business super-star status in Japan, blanket media coverage and even a manga comic book on his life.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell 1% on Tuesday, the last trading day of the decade, but notched the biggest annual gain in three years, supported by a thaw in the prolonged U.S.-China trade war and ongoing supply cuts from major oil producers. ,Brent gained about 23% in 2019 and WTI rose 34%, their biggest yearly gains in three years, backed by the recent breakthrough in the trade talks and output cuts pledged by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies. ,Forecasters do not expect oil prices to move sharply in either direction next year. Brent crude is expected to hover around $63 a barrel, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday, down modestly from current levels, as OPEC production cuts offset weaker demand. ,Over the past year, increased U.S. oil output offset the supply reductions undertaken by OPEC, led by Saudi Arabia and stemming from U.S. sanctions on Venezuela and Iran.

"(Reuters) - Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc and courier services provider Postmates Inc asked a U.S. court to block a California labor law set to go into effect on Wednesday, arguing the bill violates the U.S. Constitution. ,In a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles federal court on Monday, the companies and two app-based drivers said the law, which would make it harder for gig economy companies to qualify their workers as independent contractors rather than employees, was irrational, vague and incoherent. ,The office of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement on Monday it was reviewing the complaint.     The bill, called AB5, faces multiple legal challenges. ,The law was signed by California Governor Gavin Newsom in September and has garnered national attention, largely owing to the size of California's workforce and the state's leadership role in establishing policies that are frequently adopted by other states. ,Backers of the bill, including labor groups, have argued the law protects workers' rights. By classifying the contractors as employees, the companies would be subject to labor laws that require higher pay and other benefits such as medical insurance.    ,The bill strikes at the heart of the ""gig economy"" business model of technology platforms like Uber, Postmates, Lyft Inc, DoorDash and others who rely heavily on the state's 450,000 contract workers, not full-time employees, to drive passengers or deliver food via app-based services.  ,Uber, Postmates and other app-based companies said the legislation compromises the flexibility prized by their workforce, and that fewer workers would be hired were they considered employees. ,The companies in their Monday lawsuit called AB5 a ""thinly veiled attempt"" to target and harm gig economy businesses. Singling out app-based workers violates equal protection guaranteed under the constitutions of the United States and California, the companies argued. ,""It irreparably harms network companies and app-based independent service providers by denying their constitutional rights to be treated the same as others to whom they are similarly situated,"" the lawsuit said.  ,The companies pointed to allegedly arbitrary exemptions of different non-gig worker groups, including salespeople, travel agents, construction truck drivers and commercial fishermen. ,The full impact of the bill remains unclear in the short term, but the lawsuit cited a study saying the bill would increase ride-hailing company Lyft's operating costs by 20% and lead to some 300,000 fewer drivers in California. ,Ron Herrera, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 396 and Teamsters International vice president, said in a statement late on Monday night, that the labour union objects the lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of AB-5.  ,""Teamsters Local 396 and the broader American Labor Movement must use all of the resources at our disposal to ensure that AB-5 is protected and that workers have a voice at the table,"" Herrera added.  ,Uber, Lyft and food delivery company DoorDash have earmarked $90 million for a planned November 2020 ballot initiative that would exempt them from the law.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Drugmakers including Pfizer Inc (,), GlaxoSmithKline PLC (,) and Sanofi SA (,) are planning to hike U.S. list prices on more than 200 drugs in the United States on Wednesday, according to drugmakers and data analyzed by healthcare research firm 3 Axis Advisors. ,Nearly all of the price increases will be below 10%, and around half of them are in the range of 4 to 6%, said 3 Axis co-founder Eric Pachman. The median price increase is around 5%, he said. ,More price increases are expected to be announced later this week, which could affect the median and range. ,Soaring U.S. prescription drug prices are expected to again be a central issue in the presidential election. President Donald Trump, who made bringing them down a core pledge of his 2016 campaign, is running for re-election in 2020. ,Many branded drugmakers have pledged to keep their U.S. list price increases below 10% a year, under pressure from politicians and patients. ,Drugmakers often negotiate rebates on their list prices in exchange for favorable treatment from healthcare payers. As a result, health insurers and patients rarely pay the full list price of a drug. ,Pfizer will hike prices on more than 50 drugs, including its cancer treatment Ibrance, which is on track to bring in nearly $5 billion in revenue this year, and rheumatoid arthritis drug Xeljanz.  ,Pfizer spokeswoman Amy Rose confirmed the company's planned price increases. She said the company plans to increase the list prices on around 27% of its portfolio in the United States by an average of 5.6%.  ,Of the medicines with increases, she said 43% of them are sterile injectibles, and many of those increases are less than $1 per product. ,GlaxoSmithKline said it will raise prices on more than 30 drugs.  The company will raise prices on the blockbuster respiratory treatments it delivers through its Ellipta inhaler, its recently acquired cancer drug Zejula and on several products in its HIV-focused ViiV joint venture, according to 3 Axis Advisors. Price increases ranged between 1% and 5%. ,Sanofi said it will raise prices on around 10 of its drugs, with hikes ranging between 1% and 5%. The drugmaker noted the increases are in line with its commitment to not raise prices above medical inflation.  ,Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (,) raised prices on more than 15 drugs, in some cases by more than 6%, according to 3 Axis Advisors. A Teva spokesperson said the company regularly reviews prices in the context of market conditions, availability and cost of production. ,3 Axis advises pharmacy industry groups on identifying  inefficiencies in the U.S. drug supply chain and has provided consulting work to hedge fund billionaire John Arnold, a prominent critic of high drug prices. ,Ian Spatz, a senior adviser at consulting firm Manatt Health, said that drugmakers could be holding to relatively low price hikes in an attempt to stay out of politicians' crosshairs. Trump, for instance, targeted Pfizer after a proposed round of price increases in 2018, saying in a tweet that the drugmaker ""should be ashamed."" ,""I'm sure many manufacturers are interested in making sure they are not called out on a large list price increase,"" Spatz said. ,The United States, which leaves drug pricing to market competition, has higher prices than in other countries where governments directly or indirectly control the costs, making it the world's most lucrative market for manufacturers. ,Trump, a Republican, has struggled to deliver on a pledge to lower drug prices before the November 2020 election. His administration recently proposed a rule to allow states to import prescription drugs from Canada. ,The administration had previously scrapped an ambitious policy that would have required health insurers to pass billions of dollars in rebates they receive from drugmakers to Medicare patients. ,The House of Representatives, controlled by Democrats, passed a bill earlier in December that would cap prices for the country's most expensive drugs based on international prices and penalize drugmakers that do not negotiate with the Medicare insurance program for seniors. Trump has threatened to veto the bill, saying it would undermine access to lifesaving medicines.

"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish Airlines has agreed a compensation deal with planemaker Boeing Co over the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX following two fatal crashes, the carrier said on Tuesday. ,It did not specify the size of the payment but Turkey's Hurriyet newspaper reported that it was worth $225 million including $150 million in compensation and $75 million covering things such as spare parts and training. ,The 737 MAX has been grounded since March after a Lion Air crash in Indonesia and an Ethiopian Airlines crash killed 346 people within five months, costing the plane manufacturer more than $9 billion so far. ,Analysts say the full extent of the damage suffered by Boeing's airline customers would depend on the timing of the 737 MAX's return to service, making a settlement between the planemaker and Turkish Airlines noteworthy while the jet remains grounded. ,""Either they (Turkish Airlines) have a pretty good feeling for when this will end, or the carrier has somehow lined up alternative capacity to mitigate the damage at this point,"" Richard Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at aviation consulting firm Teal Group said. ,With a third of the compensation in the form of future services, the deal also spreads Boeing's cost over the coming years, according to Aboulafia. ""I expect them to take this approach to future settlements,"" he added. ,Turkish Airlines had taken delivery of 12 737 MAX planes before the grounding out of 75 it has ordered. It was supposed to have received 12 more since. ,In December, a media report had said Turkish Airlines was preparing to open a court case against Boeing in relation to its losses. ,Turkish is one of a number of airlines that have been seeking compensation from Boeing for the financial impact of the grounding.  ,Southwest Airlines Co, the world's largest 737 MAX operator, said earlier in December that it had reached a confidential agreement with Boeing for a portion of a projected $830 million hit to operating income in 2019. ,European charter airline TUI said on Tuesday that it was still in talks with Boeing. ,""We're at the negotiating table,"" said spokesman Martin Riecken, adding that TUI hoped to reach a settlement with Boeing but was still considering legal action. TUI was operating 15 of the planes before they were grounded and has another eight on order. ,TUI said the grounding cost it 293 million euros ($328.69 million) in its last financial year and the bill could be as high as 400 million euros in the current year depending on when the 737 MAX returns to service. ,Last week, Boeing fired CEO Dennis Muilenburg after the company repeatedly failed to contain fallout from the grounding of the 737 MAX, its best-selling jetliner. ,Boeing has acknowledged it will not be able to reach its 2019 targets and has announced it would halt 737 MAX production in January. , ($1 = 0.8914 euros) ",Business News,12/31/2019 5:47,Turkish Airlines says reaches compensation deal over Boeing 737 MAX
"(Reuters) - A federal judge rejected Tesla Inc's effort to dismiss claims by two former workers that the California electric car factory where they worked was a hotbed of racial hostility, clearing the way for a possible trial. ,In a decision on Monday, U.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco found open questions over whether Owen Diaz and his son Demetric Di-az faced ""severe and pervasive racial harassment"" in 2015 and 2016 at Tesla's factory in suburban Fremont, which employs more than 10,000 people. ,The plaintiffs, who are black, said they were subjected to repeated racial epithets dozens of times, as well as racist cartoons, and that supervisors engaged in or did little to stop the racism. ,Orrick said Diaz could pursue claims that Tesla allowed and did not take reasonable steps to stop racial harassment. ,He said punitive damages might be available if Tesla must have known about the harassment and ""ratified"" it, even if only lower level workers were directly involved. ,""The n-word is perhaps the most offensive and inflammatory racial slur in English, a word expressive of racial hatred and bigotry,"" Orrick wrote.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The fatal Dec. 29 crash of a Tesla Inc vehicle in Southern California will be investigated by the U.S. government's auto safety regulator, the agency said on Tuesday. ,The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said earlier this month it had opened an investigation into a 12th Tesla crash that may be tied to the vehicle's advanced Autopilot driver assistance system after a Tesla Model 3 rear-ended a parked police car in Connecticut. ,NHTSA did not say if autopilot was suspected in Sunday's crash in Gardena in Los Angeles county. ,Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  ,Los Angeles television station KTLA reported the driver exited the 91 Freeway in Gardena, ran a red light and struck a 2006 Honda Civic, killing its two occupants. ,The two people inside the Tesla were hospitalized but did not have life-threatening injuries, KTLA reported, citing Los Angeles police. ,Autopilot had been engaged in at least three Tesla vehicles that were involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016. The National Transportation Safety Board has criticized Autopilot's lack of safeguards and said in September in its probe of a 2018 Culver City, California Tesla crash that the system's design ""permitted the driver to disengage from the driving task."" ,Tesla and NHTSA both advise drivers that they must keep their hands on the steering wheel and pay attention at all times while using Autopilot. Tesla says Autopilot ""enables your car to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its lane,"" but does not make the vehicle autonomous. ,Some drivers say they are able to keep their hands off the wheel for extended periods when using the system. Last month, U.S. Senator Ed Markey said Tesla should disable Autopilot until it installs new safeguards to prevent drivers from evading system limits that could let them fall asleep. ,NHTSA has previously confirmed special crash investigations in a number of Tesla crashes but until earlier this month had not disclosed the total number of crashes under review.

"TOKYO (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn's daring flight from Japan, where he was awaiting trial on charges of financial wrongdoing, has revived global criticism of the nation's ""hostage justice,"" but in Japan is prompting talk of reversing more lenient curbs on defendants. ,The ousted boss of Japan's Nissan Motor Co and France's Renault SA fled to Lebanon, saying on Tuesday that he had ""escaped injustice"" and would ""no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system."" ,Ghosn was first arrested in November 2018 when his private jet landed in Tokyo and kept in jail for more than 100 days as prosecutors added more charges, all of which he has denied. He was released on $9 million bail in March - only to be arrested and bailed again the following month. ,He was facing four charges, including underreporting his Nissan salary and transferring personal financial losses to his employer's books while he ran Japan's No. 2 automaker. ,His apparent escape from Japan's legal system - Tokyo and Lebanon don't have an extradition treaty - will likely halt or even reverse a trend of recent years toward granting bail in more cases, said Colin Jones, a law professor at Doshisha Law School in Kyoto. ,""I would expect it to be more difficult for foreign defendants to get bail,"" Jones said. ,In Japan, suspects who deny the charges against them are often detained for long periods and subject to intense questioning without a lawyer present, a system critics call ""hostage justice."" ,Japanese civil rights groups and the main bar lawyers association have long criticized a system that convicts 99.9% of criminal defendants. They say it gives too much power to prosecutors, who can detain suspects for long periods before indictment, and relies too much on confessions, some later found to have been forced and false. ,Ghosn's escape is clearly a shock to Japan's legal establishment. ,""This case raises the extremely serious issue of whether it's all right to continue the trend toward bail leniency,"" said former prosecutor Yasuyuki Takai. ,""The legal profession and lawmakers need to quickly consider new legal measures or a system to prevent such escapes,"" Takai, who was formerly with the special investigation unit of the prosecutor's office, told public broadcaster NHK. ,""Until the way to achieving this is in sight, we should carefully consider temporarily halting this trend toward bail leniency."" ,The Tokyo District Court granted Ghosn bail over the objection of prosecutors because of his lawyer's assurances that the former executive would observe his unusually strict bail conditions - which included surrendering his passports, barring him from seeing his wife Carole or using the internet outside his lawyers' office. ,""But this trust was betrayed and even this high bail didn't prevent him from fleeing the country,"" Takai said. ,Tokyo-based lawyer Stephen Givens said Japan's political right is using Ghosn's flight to say, ""See, we caved in to Western demands and look what happened."" ,Still, Givens said the Ghosn case likely won't reverse the recent trend of greater willingness to grant bail, as Japan was becoming more sensitive to foreign criticism.  ,The bold escape ""may provide grounds for a backlash but only in very unusual cases,"" he said.

"TOKYO (Reuters) - The imposing home where Carlos Ghosn lived for the last seven months and probably launched a daring escape to avoid Japanese prosecutors is nestled in a leafy enclave of Tokyo where most people pay little attention to Westerners or luxury cars. ,Yet neighbors say it was impossible not to notice one of the world's most famous executives, or the black car that seemed to idle nearby whenever he was around - a stark reminder of the surveillance on the ousted Nissan Motor Co chairman while out on bail for financial misconduct charges. ,Ghosn on Tuesday said he had fled to Lebanon to escape a ""rigged"" justice system in Japan, an astonishing revelation that raises questions about how one of the world's most-recognized businessmen slipped past authorities, especially after he had surrendered his passports under the terms of his bail. ,Hana Takeda, who lives in an apartment close to the house where Ghosn has lived since May, said she would sometimes see him out walking with one of his three daughters. ,""He wasn't very secretive. I would see him hanging around with his daughter,"" Takeda, 28, told Reuters. ,The large, multi-level house is not far from the central Roppongi district in an area popular with diplomats and western executives.  ,There is a police presence because of the proximity of at least one embassy and houses for diplomats. Many homes had western luxury cars parked outside, including BMWs, Land Rovers and Bentleys. ,Three wireless security cameras peered out from the balcony above the brick porch. Under the terms of his bail, Ghosn had to have cameras installed at the house's entrance. ,No one came to the door when a Reuters reporter rang the doorbell. A double garage was shut and net curtains were drawn across the windows. Upper floor windows were covered by blinds. ,A policeman on a bicycle made regular rounds through the small neighborhood. ,Another neighbor, 62-year-old American Whitney Rich, said he had sometimes noticed a black car near the house. ,Ghosn was initially arrested in Tokyo in November 2018 and faces four charges, which he denies. They include hiding income and enriching himself through payments to Middle East dealerships. ,It seems unlikely he will now stand trial in Tokyo as Japan has no extradition treaty with Lebanon. ,It was unclear how Ghosn, who holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese citizenship, was able to orchestrate his departure from Japan. He entered Lebanon legally on a French passport, one source has told Reuters. ,In one audacious account from Lebanese TV news channel MTV, which Reuters has not been able to verify, a group of musicians arrived at Ghosn's Tokyo house, performed and then packed up their instruments with him inside one of the larger cases. He was then whisked to the airport and out of the country with the help of privately hired security. ,What is clear is that Ghosn was tightly monitored - a fact that has made his escape all the more spectacular. Authorities had monitored and restricted his movement and communications to prevent him, they said, from fleeing or tampering with evidence. ,There always seemed to be a car at the end of the street near Ghosn's house, said one Western expat who had lived in the area for nine months. ,""He kept a low profile...

"(Reuters) - German automotive supplier Robert Bosch said Thursday it has developed a sensor that lets cars ""see"" a three-dimensional view of the road, aiming to lower the cost of technology that could speed the development of self-driving vehicles. ,Privately-held Bosch said the internally-developed lidar sensor, which it will show at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas next week, will cover both long and close ranges on highways and in the city and will work in conjunction with the company's camera and radar technologies. ,Lidar technology, which uses light-based sensors to generate a three-dimensional view of the road, remains a relatively young technology that is still in flux. In its current form, it is too expensive for mass market use, but if a cheaper lidar sensor were widely adopted, it could provide more depth data that would allow self-driving cars to detect the distance to other road users like pedestrians. ,While numerous start-ups are working on lidar, the involvement of large and trusted suppliers like Bosch could help speed adoption of the technology. ,""Bosch is making automated driving a viable possibility in the first place,"" Bosch management board member Harald Kroeger said in a statement. ,Initially using bulky spinning devices placed on the roof of cars, lidar developers have transitioned to more compact solid-state devices that can be mounted on other parts of a car, such as near the headlights. These now sell for less than $10,000 in limited quantities, but analysts say they must sell for as little as $200 in mass production to become commercially viable. ,Bosch did not provide a timeline, pricing or technology details for its lidar, but a spokesman said the company is working on making the sensors ""production ready"" and the focus will be on ""affordable mass market"" technology. ,The spokesman declined to say whether Bosch already had auto customers for the sensor. ,The development of self-driving cars has hit a speed bump as costs and regulatory concerns cause automakers and tech companies to rethink their plans. ,Lidar is currently used by companies including General Motors Co (,), Ford Motor Co (,) and Alphabet Inc's (,) Waymo. Apple Inc (,) also is evaluating the technology. ,Others are less enthusiastic about adopting lidar, citing a high cost and limited capabilities - including Elon Musk's Tesla Inc (,) and Nissan Motor Co Ltd (,). ,Last April, Musk called lidar ""a fool's errand"" that was too costly and said anyone relying on the technology was ""doomed.""

"HOUSTON (Reuters) - Vastly slower U.S. oil growth this year and the prospect of a plateau for the world's top oil producer have signaled a new and  unfamiliar era of self-restraint for the go-go shale industry.  ,Spending cuts and production declines common to shale wells mean U.S. output growth is expected to brake from 2019's pace that pushed domestic production past 13 million barrels per day (bpd). Some analyst forecasts for next year call for growth to slow, potentially to a rate of just 100,000 new bpd.  ,Over the latest decade, the shale revolution turned the United States into the world's largest crude producer and a force in energy exports. Yet the revolution did not translate to higher stock prices. The S&P 500 Energy sector only gained 6% for the decade, far less than the 180% return for the broader stock market.  ,The decade-long oil expansion failed to boost profits, which has discouraged investors. The shale industry was squeezed by an OPEC price war that began in 2014, sending U.S. crude prices below $30 per barrel at one point.  ,Production temporarily slowed, but accelerated into the end of the decade as companies cut costs and grew more efficient. Now, with investor returns flagging, the industry no longer believes in drilling its way to success even at higher prices.  ,""The drumbeat has been loud and uniform from investors,"" said Parsley Energy (,) Chief Executive Officer Matt Gallagher. The shale producer's spending next year will drop about 15% and will not rise even if oil prices do, instead using higher returns to pay down debt, he said.  ,Graphic: U.S. drilling rigs at work , ,""We had to be a competitive and profitable business, not just recover resource at all cost,"" said Gallagher of the industry's shift in thinking. Parsley started paying a quarterly dividend for the first time in September.     ,Analysts currently expect U.S. crude oil to average around $58 per barrel in 2020, which would represent a modest pullback from current levels. ,Yet even if oil prices were to remain above $60 a barrel next year, analysts say it will not spur another production spurt because of the pressure for returns. Despite U.S. and international crude prices gaining 26% and 26%, respectively, the S&P 500 Energy Index [.SPNY] rose less than 8% in 2019. ,""Our view is that (rapid growth) is kind of over,"" said Raoul LeBlanc, an energy analyst with consultancy IHS Markit. Because oil output from shale drops off quickly, wells require constant, costly drilling to keep production levels steady. ,In Texas, home of the Permian Basin shale field, the finishing touches to coax a well to produce, called completions, fell 16% though November, according to the state's energy regulator. Hiring in the Permian also dropped sharply in late 2019, according to career website LinkedIn.  ,As shale's outlook cools, the only oil producers maintaining annual Permian growth rates near 40% are giants Exxon Mobil Corp (,) and Chevron Corp (,) and some private operators, said Artem Abramov, head of shale research at consultancy Rystad Energy.  ,Morgan Stanley noted in early December that publicly traded shale companies' output growth was just 460,000 bpd for the 12 months ending in September, compared with 1.3 million bpd for the 12 months before that. ,Graphic: Fewer new jobs in top U.S. shale patch signal end of hiring boom , ,Financing for new production has been sharply limited. Private equity firms that funded explorers and profited by selling to rivals now must nurture these operations for the long haul, said Adam Waterous, chief executive of private equity firm Waterous Energy Fund.  ,""In 50 years of investment in oil and gas investment that has never been seen before,"" Waterous said at a December investment conference in Houston. The change has investors in a state that resembles the five stages of grief, he joked.  ,U.S. producers are ""still going to need another year or two to get free cash flow yields up to levels that are competitive,"" said Rob Thummel, portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital, which owns shares in shale producers' Concho Resources Inc (,), Diamondback Energy Inc (,) and Pioneer Natural Resources Co.

Others were damaged during protests on Christmas Eve.  ,The two lions were daubed with graffiti and briefly set alight after being doused in a flammable liquid. ,HSBC said on Thursday initial cleaning of the lions had begun.  ,""We are engaging conservation experts to advise us on the professional restoration required and the process can take time,"" the bank said in a statement.  ,More than 90% of the $4.4 billion generated by HSBC's retail banking and wealth management unit in the six months to last June, came from Hong Kong. ,HSBC has also deployed billions of dollars in China's southern Pearl River Delta region, adjacent to Hong Kong, and has expanded its services in the world's second largest economy. ,Some analysts believe HSBC executives will have to explain their Hong Kong strategy when they discuss annual results on Feb. 18. ,John Cronin, an analyst with Goodbody, said he expects to hear about a push to grow in other Asian nations, especially emerging markets, as unrest in Hong Kong continues. ,""Even putting aside the political turmoil in Hong Kong, HSBC's dependence on Hong Kong for profitability is something I expect that management will seek to tackle,"" Cronin told Reuters.  ,Beijing plans to integrate the Pearl River Delta and Hong Kong and Macau to create an economic powerhouse under its Greater Bay Area Initiative.  ,HSBC's entanglement in the protests underlines the tightrope that companies have had to walk since the protests got going in June in response to a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party. ,The demonstrations have evolved into a broad pro-democracy movement. ,""Clearly, there is a fine line for management to draw between customers and the Chinese authorities,"" said a head of corporate governance at a UK-based asset manager and HSBC shareholder. ,Other Hong Kong companies have been damaged by being perceived to be too supportive of the protests. ,Cathay Pacific Airways (,) was forced by Beijing to suspend staff involved in the protests, and chief executive Rupert Hogg and his top deputy resigned in August amid the turmoil.  ,HSBC has previously been targeted by supporters of Beijing. ,Users of China's Weibo social media platform shared screenshots last year of an HSBC employee's Facebook posts supporting the protests. The posts urged readers to complain to HSBC management.  ,""Businesses now have to consider how three different groups will react to their decisions: The Chinese government, Hong Kong protesters, and Chinese consumers,"" said Kent Kedl, head of Control Risks' Greater China practice.

"(Reuters) - Ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn decided to flee Japan after learning that his trial had been delayed until April 2021 and also because he had not been allowed to speak to his wife, sources close to Ghosn said on Thursday. ,Ghosn, 65, the former head of Renault, and one of the best known figures in the car industry, faces four charges - which he denies - including hiding income and enriching himself through payments to dealerships in the Middle East. ,Following are some of the main dates in the case from his arrest 14 months ago to his audacious escape this week. ,Dec. 31, 2019: ,Ghosn said he had fled to Lebanon to escape a ""rigged"" justice system in Japan, raising questions about how one of the world's most-recognized executives had slipped away while on bail. ,It was unclear how Ghosn, who holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese citizenship, was able to orchestrate his departure from Japan. He had been under strict surveillance by authorities while out on bail and had surrendered his passports. ,April 25, 2019: ,Ghosn walked out of a Japanese jail, freed on bail for a second time, after agreeing to curbs on contacting his wife as he awaited trial on financial misconduct charges. ,April 4, 2019: ,Japanese prosecutors arrested Ghosn again on suspicion the former Nissan boss had tried to enrich himself at the automaker's expense, in another dramatic twist that his lawyers said was an attempt to muzzle him. ,This marked the fourth time that prosecutors had arrested the once-feted executive, a scandal that has rocked the global auto industry and shone a harsh light on Japan's judicial system. ,March 6, 2019: ,Ghosn, who had been detained for more than 100 days, left a Tokyo prison on a $9 million bail, slipping past reporters in a face mask and moving closer to mounting a defense against financial misconduct charges that he has called ""meritless"". ,Surrounded by security guards and dressed in a workman's uniform and a blue cap, Ghosn's face was obscured by thick glasses and the surgical-type mask. ,Jan. 8, 2019: ,Ghosn declared his innocence in his first public appearance since his arrest in November 2018, telling a Tokyo court that he had been wrongly accused of financial misconduct. ,Ghosn was brought into the courtroom in handcuffs and a rope around his waist, wearing a navy suit and white shirt without a tie, and looking thinner than before his arrest, with his dark hair showing grey roots. ,Dec. 21, 2018: ,Japanese prosecutors arrested Ghosn again on new allegations of making Nissan shoulder $16.6 million in personal investment losses, dashing chances he would be released on bail before Christmas. ,Dec.10, 2018: ,Tokyo prosecutors indicted Ghosn for allegedly under-reporting his income. They also re-arrested him on allegations of understating his income for three more years through March 2018. ,Nov. 19, 2018: ,Japanese police arrested Ghosn when he arrived at a Tokyo airport in his private jet and prosecutors accused him of under-reporting his salary by roughly half over a five-year period through March 2015.

"BEIRUT/TOKYO (Reuters) - Lebanon received an Interpol arrest warrant on Thursday for former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn, while Turkey launched an investigation into his daring escape from Japan via Istanbul. ,Ghosn has become an international fugitive after he revealed on Tuesday he had fled to Lebanon to escape what he called a ""rigged"" justice system in Japan, where he faces charges relating to alleged financial crimes.     ,Sources close to Ghosn said a delay to a trial and a strict ban on communicating with his wife motivated him to go ahead with a plan to use a private security company to smuggle him out of Japan via private jet. ,The Interpol red notice, which calls on authorities to arrest a wanted person, was received by Lebanon's internal security forces and has yet to be referred to the judiciary, a Lebanese judicial source told Reuters. ,A senior Lebanese security official said it was not yet clear if Ghosn would be summoned for questioning over the warrant but said Lebanon does not extradite its citizens to foreign states. ,In past cases in which Lebanon has received red notices for Lebanese citizens resident in the country, the suspects have not been detained but their passports have been confiscated and bail has been set, the judicial source said. ,Ghosn holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian citizenship. He has deep ties to Lebanon, the country of his childhood, where his investments include a stake in a bank, real estate and a vineyard.  ,Sources close to Ghosn said he met with Lebanese President Michel Aoun shortly after arriving to Beirut and was greeted warmly, though the presidency denied such a meeting took place. ,Speaking to broadcaster MTV, caretaker defense minister Elias Bou Saab said Lebanon played no official role in Ghosn's exit from Japan.  ,Turkish police on Thursday detained seven people, including four pilots, as part of an investigation into Ghosn's passage through the country, a police spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman said the other detainees were two airport ground staff and one cargo worker, and all seven were expected to give statements in court on Thursday. ,Flight tracking data suggests Ghosn used two different planes to fly to Istanbul and then to Lebanon. ,The sources close to Ghosn said he was prompted to flee after a recent court session in which he learned that the second of two trials would be delayed until April 2021. ,""They said they needed another whole year to prepare for it. ... He was distressed about not being able to see or speak to his wife,"" one of the sources close to Ghosn said. ,A request to see or speak to his wife over Christmas was also denied, the sources added, part of strict conditions set on his bail. ,The sources said Ghosn had grown distressed that authorities were pressuring his family to draw a confession from him after his daughter and son were questioned by Japanese prosecutors in the United States in early December. ,In just his second public comment since landing in Beirut, Ghosn said in a statement his family played no role whatsoever in his exit from Japan. ,""I alone arranged for my departure,"" he said.  ,Ghosn was first arrested in Tokyo in November 2018 and faces four charges for alleged financial crimes including hiding income and enriching himself through payments to car dealerships in the Middle East. He denies the charges. ,Japanese public broadcaster NHK said on Thursday Japanese authorities allowed Ghosn to carry a spare French passport in a locked case while out on bail, potentially shedding some light on how he managed to escape despite having passports held by Japanese lawyers. ,No one was immediately available for comment at the office of Ghosn's lawyer, Junichiro Hironaka, at the French embassy in Tokyo, or at the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office. ,Nissan ousted him as chairman, saying internal investigations revealed misconduct including understating his salary while he was its chief executive, and transferring $5 million of Nissan funds to an account in which he had an interest.

"(Reuters) - The value of U.S. oil and gas mergers and acquisitions reached a five-year peak of $96 billion in 2019 on the back of competing bids for Anadarko Petroleum, energy data provider Enverus said on Thursday. ,Occidental Petroleum Corp's (,) $38 billion acquisition of Permian rival Anadarko countered a pullback in corporate deal-making the sector, driven by investor pressure to prioritize shareholder returns over growth, Enverus said.  ,Occidental last year won a takeover battle for Anadarko, topping Chevron Corp's (,) $33 billion offer, after Berkshire Hathaway Inc's (,) Warren Buffett and France's Total SA (,) came to its aid. ,Without that acquisition, the total value of deals in 2019 would have been $39.1 billion, well below the $85 billion recorded in 2018, according to Enverus. The data provider valued the Anadarko deal at $57 billion, including debt taken on by the acquirer. ,""Investors who funded the shale revolution over the last decade have become vocal in advocating for payouts and cut back on providing new capital. That flowed through to limited M&A and a negative reaction to deals for much of the year,"" said Andrew Dittmar, senior M&A analyst at Enverus.           ,However, the total M&A spend in 2019 was the highest since 2014, when oil prices peaked at $112 per barrel before beginning a slump that saw prices drop by half of that.  ,Most of the last year's marquee deals focused on the Permian basin of Texas and New Mexico, which is at the heart of the shale boom that has helped the United States become the world's biggest producer of crude oil. ,Enverus predicts M&A would rise this year, after ticking up in the fourth quarter of 2019, as smaller players with good land but less access to capital are gobbled up by those with free cash flow.       ,Apart from Occidental-Anadarko, 2019's largest corporate deals in the sector were Callon Petroleum Co's (,) $2.7 billion merger with Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc, WPX Energy Inc's (,) $2.5 billion buy of Felix Energy, and Parsley Energy Inc's (,) $2.3 billion acquisition of Jagged Peak Energy JAG.N.

"BEIJING (Reuters) - China has decided to keep its inflation target unchanged this year at around 3%, sources say, suggesting policymakers will continue to roll out more economic support measures while avoiding aggressive stimulus. ,Some analysts have speculated that Beijing will raise the inflation target to 3.5%, which would give authorities more room to support the world's second-largest economy as growth tails off to the slowest in nearly 30 years. ,But policy sources told Reuters the government expects surging food prices to start easing in the second half of the year, as the government takes steps to address pork shortages.     ,The 2020 inflation target, to be unveiled at the annual parliamentary session in early March, was endorsed by top leaders at the annual closed-door Central Economic Work Conference last month, according to three sources with knowledge of the meeting's outcome. ,""The target will still be around 3%"", one of the policy sources said. ""We cannot rule out the possibility that inflation may break 5% in the coming months but that could be short-lived"". ,The State Council Information Office and the National Development and Reform Commission - the state planner, did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. ,China's consumer price inflation (CPI) accelerated to a near eight-year high of 4.5% in November, as pork prices doubled due to a massive outbreak of African swine fever, but producer prices have remained in deflation for five straight months. ,The diverging price trends have complicated policymakers' efforts to revive activity without risking overstimulating the economy.  ,While Beijing has rolled out a series of support measures in the last two years, mainly in the form of higher infrastructure spending and tax cuts, leaders have pledged they will not embark on massive stimulus like that during the 2008-09 global crisis, which saddled the economy with a mountain of debt. ,China has kept its inflation target at around 3% since 2015. ,While food prices have spiked, there has been little sign of a pick-up in inflation across the broader economy, suggesting demand remains sluggish. Core inflation - which excludes food and energy prices - has stayed largely subdued. ,""Currently, the CPI rise is mainly due to pork prices - this is a structural, not a broad-spread price rise. Pork prices could start to fall in the second half,"" said a second source.     ,Still, the government may face a tough job in keeping inflation below 3% this year, policy insiders said, adding that rising inflation expectations could reinforce the central bank's cautious approach to further policy easing.  ,""A lower inflation target could help cool down the inflation expectation which is one of major forces driving up the headline inflation during the upper cycle,"" said Steven Zhang, chief economist and head of research at Morgan Stanley Huaxin Securities. ,""The government may have higher than expected confidence to curb the food inflation despite the surging pork prices.""  ,On Wednesday, the central bank announced its eighth cut since early 2018 in banks' reserve requirements (RRR), or the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves, in a bid to shore up the economy.  ,Analysts expect at least one more RRR cut this year. ,The central bank has also begun lowering its key lending rate in recent months, with more expected possibly before the end of this month, but the cuts have been far smaller than substantial easing in the United States and many other economies over the past year. ,Policy sources have told Reuters that Beijing plans to set a lower economic growth target of around 6% in 2020. ,China's third-quarter growth slowed to 6%, still among the fastest in the world but its weakest expansion in nearly three decades.

"CHICAGO/DIMMITT, Texas (Reuters) - Across snow-covered North Dakota, U.S. farmers are stuck with fields full of weather-damaged corn - a crop they planted after the U.S.-China trade war killed their soybean market. Many don't know yet what crops they'll plant next season among a host of dicey options. ,In Texas, Kansas and Colorado, farmers are weighing whether they should plant fewer acres of corn and more sorghum, even though China has all but stopped buying it. That's because sorghum costs about half as much as corn to plant, which appeals to farmers wary of investing too much for an uncertain return. ,As the U.S. farm economy reels from the worst harvest in decades after nearly two years of the trade war, U.S. grain growers are struggling to decide what crops might keep them in business. ,U.S. President Donald Trump announced last month that China had agreed to double its pre-trade war purchases of U.S. agricultural products over the next two years as part of a Phase 1 trade deal. That brought little comfort to U.S. farmers because China still has not confirmed the commitment or signed any deal. ,""President Trump said that we're all going to need to go buy bigger tractors,"" said North Dakota farmer Justin Sherlock. ""I don't think many farmers are going to invest much money until we see that this is a done deal and a long-term deal."" ,Trump administration officials say the Phase 1 trade deal with China will be signed in January, though many tariffs will remain in place during further negotiation. Commodity market analysts and agricultural economists warn an agreement won't be an immediate fix for the U.S. farm economy because the conflict has spurred China to develop new supply chains. ,China has, for instance, deepened ties with rival exporters such as Brazil and Argentina. Brazilian soy cultivation is expanding after record exports to China in the past year and China is investing in South American ports. ,Making matters worse, China's need for soy and sorghum to feed livestock is waning because of a deadly pig disease that experts estimate has killed off about half the world's largest hog herd. China's hog industry has also worked to reformulate pig rations to include less soy and more alternative feeds that don't have to be imported from the United States. ,""We won't go immediately back to where we were 18 months ago - maybe not for a long time,"" Jay Debertin, chief executive officer of CHS Inc, the largest U.S. farmer cooperative, told grain producers at a recent conference in North Dakota.  ,Many U.S. farmers have tried shifting crops to dodge the economic fallout from losing such a crucial export market. They planted 76.5 million acres of soybeans in 2019, 14.3% fewer than the previous year, according to the latest U.S. Department of Agriculture data. U.S. plantings of sorghum - used in livestock feed and the fiery Chinese liquor baijiu - dipped about 7.5% in 2019, to 5.3 million acres. Plantings of cotton have dropped, too, as China pulled back on purchases. ,Plantings of such China-dependent crops likely would have fallen much further were it not for the Trump administration's allocation of $24.5 billion in aid to compensate farmers for trade-war losses. The bailouts gave many farmers an incentive to keep planting crops such as soybeans that they knew would be difficult to sell at any profitable price. Government handouts are expected to account for nearly a third of 2019 net farm income, according to federal government and bank regulatory data. ,Trump administration officials have not said if farmers will get more payments in 2020. Robert Johansson, chief economist at USDA, told Reuters he expected the interim trade deal would solve the issues that the aid program had addressed. ,USDA Deputy Press Secretary Alec Varsamis said the agency would decide in January on future payments. White House spokesman Judd Deere declined to comment and referred to previous statements by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who has said China committed to ""massive"" U.S. agriculture purchases. ,Farmers in export-dependent regions say they can't continue to sell their crops for below the cost of production without a third round of subsidies to cover the losses. ,""If the government doesn't pay us, we're done,"" said Sherlock, who did not vote for Trump in 2016 and remains undecided for 2020. ,Most farmers have backed the president as he seeks re-election, according to polls by Reuters and farm media outlets. In 2016, they were drawn to Trump's promise to shake up Washington bureaucracy and hoped the trade war, although it might bring short-term losses, would eventually improve the size and scope of China's U.S. agricultural purchases. ,Farmers last season intended to use more of their land for corn – a crop aimed at markets outside China - but that backfired for many growers when extreme weather prevented planting on millions of acres. Early seed orders for 2020 suggest farmers will again turn to corn to replace soybeans, China's largest agricultural import. Scott Beck - president of Beck's Hybrids, the largest family-owned U.S. retail seed company - told Reuters that sales of corn seed for 2020 planting are already up about 40% from 2019. ,Sherlock and many of his neighbors last spring sowed one of North Dakota's largest-ever corn crops by acreage. They were enticed by rising springtime prices and the promise of trade aid as long as they planted something. They figured their corn would find buyers among domestic livestock or ethanol producers or in established export markets such as Japan, South Korea or Mexico. But bad weather left almost 60% of the state's corn - about 2 million acres - unfit for harvest at winter's onset, according to USDA. ,Many growers are caught in limbo. Their fields are not bad enough to trigger crop insurance payouts but not good enough to recoup costs. And trade-aid payments for North Dakota are not robust enough to cover losses, with larger per-acre aid payments flowing to southern states. ,Sherlock says he might contract to grow more soybeans for a local seed company, a niche crop that costs more to grow but could reap higher prices. Field peas, used in grain-free pet foods, are another option. ,Iowa corn and soybean farmer Mitchell Hora is also seeking alternatives. He sowed winter wheat and rye in fall of 2018 and sold the cleaned seed to fellow producers, and has more recently contracted to sell rye to a start-up malting company. ,""The agricultural system is completely broken"" because of the trade war, severe weather and mounting farm debt, Hora said. ""We have to farm smarter."" ,Farmers in the High Plains of Texas, the second-largest sorghum-producing state, also face hard choices. China's imports of U.S. sorghum in 2019 were less than one-tenth of the volume purchased four years earlier, according to the most recent government data. ,Still, the production cost for an acre of sorghum in this heavily irrigated region will be about half the cost of planting corn, according to Texas A&M AgriLife Extension data.

"OSLO (Reuters) - New electric car sales in Norway rose by a third last year amid soaring demand for Tesla Inc's (,) vehicles, but the pioneering U.S. company will face a more competitive market in 2020 as rivals prepare to launch new electric models. ,Fully electric cars made up 42.4% of sales in the Nordic country last year, a global record, rising from a 31.2% market share in 2018 and just 5.5% in 2013, the Norwegian Road Federation said on Friday. ,Norway, which is Europe's biggest oil and gas producer, is seeking to become the first country to end the sale of fossil-fueled cars by 2025. The country has exempted battery-powered vehicles from the taxes imposed on petrol and diesel engines and after just a few years the streets of Oslo have become quieter and have less air pollution. ,Most of Norway's top-10 cars in 2019 were electric, including Volkswagen's Golf (,), Nissan's (,) Leaf, Audi's (,) e-tron, BMW's (,) i3, Jaguar's I-PACE and several of Hyundai's (,) models. ,New car sales in the country last year were 142,381, of which 60,316 were fully electric.    This year, as many as six in 10 of all new cars sold in the country could be fully electric, said Volkswagen (VW) distributor Harald A. Moeller AS, which is preparing to launch several models in 2020. ,Other importers predicted the market share in 2020 would be in a range of 50-60% of all sales. ,""The electrification of the car market is accelerating ... we forecast electric vehicles to hold a 100% market share in 2025,"" Volkswagen said of the outlook for Norway. ,The country's best-selling car in 2019 was Tesla's mid-sized Model 3 sedan, which retails from 384,900 Norwegian crowns  ($43,721.74), racking up an 11% market share in the California-based firm's first attempt at cracking the mass market. ,Rising global awareness of climate change has encouraged a shift in regulation, technology and consumer preferences, disrupting the auto industry and boosting Tesla's share price to make it one of the world's most highly valued car brands. ,This year, the company will start producing a medium-sized sport utility vehicle, the Model Y, but faces competition from a plethora of rivals, including by Daimler AG's Mercedes-Benz, VW's Audi and Ford Motor Co (,). ,""There will be between 20 and 30 new electric models on the market in 2020, many of them launching early in the year,"" the Norwegian Electric Vehicle Association said in a statement. ,Ford late last year unveiled the Mustang Mach-E SUV, which it hopes will help turn around its flagging fortunes. ,""It will compete with Tesla's models 3 and Y. I also think Audi e-tron is a big competitor. The customers have waited for this car for over two years,"" said Kjetil Hagestande, chief executive of Ford importer RoehneSelmer. ,""This amazing car with four-wheel drive and long range fits the Norway market perfectly,"" Hagestande told Reuters on the sidelines of the Mach-E launch in November. ,Also aiming for a slice of Norway's market is China's Geely [GEELY.UL] group, whose Polestar and Volvo brands will begin producing fully electric cars this year. ,In October, Polestar opened its first European showroom in Oslo's most upmarket shopping district, rubbing shoulders with fashion designers rather than with rival auto makers. ,""I'm here to consider a new car because my wife already has her second electric car, a Hyundai,"" said Espen Cook, a retired IT worker, on a recent visit to the Polestar venue. ,""Two months ago I sold my hybrid Lexus so I would like to go full electric,"" the 70-year-old told Reuters.  ,($1 = 8.8034 Norwegian crowns) ",Business News,1/3/2020 9:22,"After Tesla's record year in Norway, rivals gear up for 2020"

The company says on its website it has eight shops in Hong Kong. ,The newspaper said the decision to close the shop came after the company failed to reach an agreement with its landlord to cut the rent in the mall outlet. ,Wharf Holdings, the shopping center's owner and Vuitton did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  ,Vuitton's parent group LVMH (,), the Paris-based conglomerate behind other fashion brands like Christian Dior and Hennessy cognac, declined to comment. ,High-end fashion labels have hunkered down in Hong Kong since anti-government demonstrations escalated in June, hoping the turmoil would ease in one of the world's top shopping destinations. ,Until now, the luxury brands had only shut stores in Hong Kong temporarily when protests flared.      ,Hong Kong has long drawn numerous tourists from the Chinese mainland who pick up luxury cosmetics, accessories and clothing at slightly lower prices than at home. ,But as the protests dragged on, tourist arrivals have slumped and losses began to trickle through to third-quarter earnings. ,Hong Kong's retail sales fell 23.6% from a year earlier in November to HK$30 billion ($3.85 billion), government data showed on Friday, in the tenth consecutive month of declines. ,The protests have spilled into 2020, with some 400 people arrested in New Year's Day demonstrations when a pro-democracy march descended into chaos. ,Some brands are weighing up redirecting some of their investments elsewhere, including to the Chinese mainland and other parts of Asia where many have managed to make up for lost sales in Hong Kong.  ,Executives at LVMH and its rivals like puffer jacket maker Moncler (,) or Gucci-owner Kering (,) have said they were trying to renegotiate notoriously high rents in Hong Kong as one way of mitigating the hit to operating margins.  ,But the brands are likely to have to contemplate a larger retreat from Hong Kong in the longer term, where some have too many shops, consultancy Bain said in November. ,HSBC (,) (,) will suspend overnight services at 19 ATM clusters in Hong Kong on weekends and public holidays, the bank said on Friday, two days after its branches and ATMs were targeted during protests.

"(Reuters) - The U.S. manufacturing sector fell into its deepest slump in more than a decade in December as the U.S.-China trade war kept a lid on factory output, orders and employment, although the long-awaited Phase 1 deal between Washington and Beijing could limit further downside. ,The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) said its index of national factory activity fell to 47.2 last month from 48.1 in November. It was the lowest reading since June 2009 and, coupled with readings for both new orders and factory employment at multi-year lows, thwarted expectations for a leveling off in the pace of decline in a sector buffeted by trade tensions.  ,A reading below 50 indicates the sector is in contraction, and December's reading marked the fifth straight month below that benchmark level. Economists polled by Reuters had been looking for an increase to 49.0. ,The manufacturing sector had been under pressure for much of the second half of 2019, as tit-for-tat tariffs by the United States and China slowed the flow of goods between the world's two largest economies and contributed to a cooling in the pace of global economic growth. ,Last month, the two sides announced they had reached agreement on a Phase 1 deal, and U.S. President Donald Trump this week said the accord would be signed on Jan. 15 in Washington, and talks to cement a wider Phase 2 deal would begin shortly. ,""Global trade remains the most significant cross-industry issue, but there are signs that several industry sectors will improve as a result of the Phase 1 trade agreement,"" Timothy Fiore, chair of ISM's Manufacturing Business Survey Committee, said in a statement. ,In addition to the drag from trade frictions, Boeing Co's (,) inability to get its 737 Max jetliner back in service may have been a factor, especially in the transportation equipment industry, which was the weakest of the six big industry sectors, according to Fiore. Boeing will cease production of the plane this month until regulators allow it to resume flying in the wake of two crashes, and that could be a headwind in the coming months that may counter improvements arising elsewhere from the trade deal. ,While ISM's overall measure of activity in December was the lowest in more than a decade, Fiore said on balance the contraction remains relatively shallow. ,""It's not super low,"" he said on a conference call. ""We're still in that range of slight contraction to slight expansion."" ,Typically the index would have to drop below 43 to signal the risk of a wider economic recession. Weakness in the manufacturing sector was one of the concerns that spurred the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates three times last year, although the central bank appears to be done with lowering borrowing costs for now, with officials like Fed Chair Jerome Powell satisfied the economy is in ""a good place."" ,Overall, the U.S. economy did appear to be in relatively sound condition near the end of 2019, supported by low unemployment and healthy consumer spending, which accounts for roughly 70% of economic activity.  ,The housing sector also appears to be contributing to the growth picture after a prolonged run as a drag. In a separate report, the Commerce Department said U.S. construction spending rose more than expected in November and builders also spent more in earlier months than previously estimated.  ,Construction spending increased 0.6% in November, beating analysts' consensus forecast of a 0.3% gain. Data for October and September was revised to show increases in spending, a reversal from previous estimates of contractions in spending during those months. ,The gain in November was driven by a 1.9% increase in private home-building, an indication the Fed's rate cuts last year, which drove mortgage rates lower, were boosting the economy. ,Meanwhile, several of the largest U.S. automakers on Friday reported another year of stable sales of pickup trucks, fueled by holiday season discounts and lower interest rates on vehicle loans, even as demand for passenger cars fell further. ,Analysts expect overall 2019 vehicle sales to fall by about 1% from 2018, but still finish above 17 million vehicles for the fifth consecutive year.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors rushed into safe-haven assets on Friday after U.S. air strikes in Iraq killed a senior Iranian military official, sending the Japanese yen to a three-month high, while the U.S. dollar index was knocked by the weakest domestic factory activity in a decade. ,In addition to the yen, U.S. Treasuries, German bunds and gold rallied after the overnight air strike in Baghdad killed Qassem Soleimani, Tehran's most prominent military commander and the architect of its growing military influence in the Middle East. ,""Overall, geopolitical risk premia have risen substantially overnight,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at Cambridge Global Payments.

"(Reuters) - Axon Enterprise Inc (,) on Friday sued the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in a bid to have antitrust proceedings over an acquisition heard in a federal court and not in an internal FTC process, claiming that the FTC's ability to both prosecute and judge cases deprives companies of their constitutional rights. ,Axon, the manufacturer of Taser stun guns and body camera systems for police departments, said in its complaint that it has been cooperating with an FTC probe of its acquisition of Vievu for more than 18 months. Vievu was a smaller player in the market for body cameras and online storage and management of the footage they generate.  ,In the complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Arizona, Axon denied that the Vievu deal was anticompetitive and said it ""is eager to prove its case in any federal court in this country. ,""But Axon cannot - and will not - accept the FTC's attempts to extort an irrational 'settlement' through a biased adjudicative process that vests the Commission with the powers of prosecutor, judge, and jury in violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection guarantees of the U.S. Constitution."" it said. ,Last month, Axon alleges, FTC officials told the company it would have to unwind the Vievu acquisition by divesting the assets and offering patent licenses to any potential acquirer. ,According to Axon, in a December 2019 face-to-face meeting with its attorney, the FTC threatened to start an internal administrative law proceeding this month to unwind the Vievu deal if Axon would not agree to the settlement. ,The FTC, in an administrative complaint filed late Friday afternoon, said the Vievu deal had reduced competition in the market for supplying body cameras to large police departments.  ,""The Commission is taking action to ensure that police officers have access to the cutting-edge products they need to do their job, and police departments benefit from the lower prices and innovative products that competition had provided before the acquisition,"" Ian Conner, director of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, said in a statement. ,Axon Chief Executive Rick Smith responded that the company would stand by its effort to block an ""unconstitutional"" administrative process with the FTC. ,The FTC can choose to file antitrust actions either in a federal court or via an internal administrative law procedure. ,Axon alleges that FTC's internal administrative proceedings are unfair because they can only be appealed to the full FTC commission. While an FTC decision can be appealed to a federal appeals court, no new facts or evidence can be introduced, making it harder to overturn the case, Axon argued.

"(Reuters) - 1/OIL BACK ON THE BOIL ,Geopolitics is back in the driving seat. The U.S. killing of a top Iranian commander has doused the nascent New Year rally and delivered a $3 boost for oil prices on fears that any violent retaliation from Tehran would disrupt energy supplies.  ,Brent crude futures LCOc1 have actually only risen to their highest since mid-September, when an attack on Saudi Arabian crude facilities sparked the biggest price jump in more than 30 years. Whether oil markets calm down and stocks resume their climb hinges on what happens next.  ,September's oil price spike was short lived as Riyadh didn't respond to the attacks, which the U.S. blamed on Iran and which  Iran in turn denied. However, if Iran fulfils its threat of ""severe retaliation"" over the killing of General Qassem Soleimani it could well magnify market moves. ,Any conflict and surging oil prices risk snuffing out the nascent global economic recovery. ,(GRAPHIC: Geopolitical tensions rattle world markets, ,) ,(GRAPHIC: Oil on the boil , ,) ,The ructions in the Middle East are a reminder of how hard it will be to kill off a near four-decade-long bull market. ,Global bonds had a tepid start to 2020 following a year when U.S. and German borrowing costs posted their biggest annual falls in five years. With a resolution to the U.S.-China trade spat in sight and recession risks receding, super-low bond yields no longer seemed justified. German 10-year government bond yields touched seven-month highs on the first trading day of the new year, while 15-year yields briefly edged above 0% for the first time since July. The U.S. yield curve — a classic indicator of recession risk — is near its steepest levels since October.  ,Upcoming readings of euro zone inflation and U.S. employment could encourage further bond selling, should they beat forecasts, but most still think it's too early to call time on the rally. For all the talk that sovereign bonds are expensive, many investors are still clearly sticking with them.  ,(GRAPHIC: Germany's 10-year Bund yield  ,) ,Friday brings the first U.S. jobs release of the decade. While it will be hard to beat the 2010s for growth and equity gains, the December 2019 figures could extend year-end bullishness and amplify campaign braggadocio from President Donald Trump. ,Leading up to November's election, he seems to have little to worry about on the economic front. November's 3.5% jobless rate was the lowest in half a century and the 266,000 jobs added were the most in 10 months. Last month's hiring is forecast to have eased to 165,000, still well above the 100,000-a-month rate needed to keep up with growth in the working age population.    ,    The labour picture suggests Trump's trade war with China has not had much impact on the broader economy, which clipped along at a 2.1% pace in the third quarter. Manufacturing hiring did take a hit but hopes are high for a Phase 1 trade deal on January 15.

Once parliament approves the agreement, the clock starts ticking on Britain's future trade relationship with the EU. If an agreement isn't reached by end-2020, the outcome may yet be that Britain is cut loose without trade arrangements in place.  ,However, with one Brexit step likely taken by the end of the month, sterling could react more than last year to economic data. Reuters polls predict the final reading of December's UK services activity on Monday will reveal a slight uptick though stay in contraction territory below 50.

"SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester, among the Fed policymakers most concerned that easy monetary policy would risk excessive inflation, said on Friday she has put those fears to rest for now and is willing to leave rates at their current level absent some substantial change in the economy. ,Her comments in an interview with Reuters on the sidelines of the American Economic Association conference suggest how firmly the Fed is anchored to its current setting for overnight interest rates, fixed in a range of between 1.5% and 1.75% after three rate cuts last year. ,Advocates for even deeper rate reductions now agree the current setting is helping the economy enough that the Fed can stand pat while Mester and others who worried that lower rates might court faster inflation or risky lending have concluded that at this point there is little cause for concern. ,""I have been kind of forecasting inflation to go up to 2% for quite a while and we have been undershooting,"" said Mester, who assumes a voting role this year on the Fed's policy-setting committee. ,Mester, who was skeptical last year that rate cuts were needed, said, ""I think we are really well calibrated now."" A rate increase would not be needed, ""until I see either financial stability issues looming or some indication that inflation is going to pick up strongly. I don't see that now and it is not in my forecast."" ,""You want to see that inflation really is at 2%. You want persistence. You want to be able to say that I am confident now that inflation is meeting our goal,"" which was set at 2% in 2012 but never consistently achieved, she said. ,Fed policymakers through much of last year were divided among those who wanted to cut rates fast and deep in response to what they saw as rising recession risks, and those who felt cutting rates at a time of historically low unemployment was a recipe for trouble. ,Over that same time, inflation remained weak and concern grew that inflation expectations — a key determinant of the future pace of price increases — might be drifting lower, an echo of the troubles Japan and Europe have had with weak price increases. ,Mester said she now feels that a further drop in inflation is a bigger risk than an unexpected jump in prices, and is prepared to keep policy looser for longer. ,""Keeping your policy path more accommodative ... is appropriate,"" she said. Inflation ""a little bit above 2% does not bother me.""  ",Business News,1/4/2020 1:36,"Fed's Mester, who warned of inflation risks, says current policy 'well calibrated'"
"SAN DIEGO (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve could find itself fighting too-low inflation for years to come, San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly said on Friday, and may need a new policy framework to lift inflation back up to the Fed's 2% goal. ,""We don't have a really good understanding of why it's been so difficult to get inflation back up,"" Daly said at the annual American Economics Association meeting in San Diego.  ,But with global growth slowing and the populations of most advanced economies aging, Daly said, ""this new 'fighting inflation from below' is going to be with us, I would argue, for a longer period of time than just a few years.""      ,As a result, she said, ""a new policy framework will likely be required"" to boost inflation.  ,Daly and her fellow policymakers are in the midst of a year-plus review of possible new approaches, including one in which  the Fed would encourage too-high inflation to make up for periods of low inflation. Early indications are that any changes will likely be modest. ,The Fed expects to release the results of its review in mid-2020. ,The Fed lowered U.S. interest rates three times last year, to a target range between 1.5% and 1.75%, in part to keep inflation from sinking amid rising global economic headwinds.  ,Now that at least some of those factors, including U.S.-China trade tensions, have eased a bit, policymakers say they will keep rates where they are, barring a material change in the economic outlook.  ,Sluggish inflation gives the Fed room to keep interest rates low and probe how far down it can push unemployment, now near a 50-year low and well below what economists have long estimated should represent a fully employed American workforce, Daly said.  ,""It's a great benefit that you can let the economy run a little bit more and you can actually see what full employment looks like,"" Daly said. ,But at the same time, low inflation poses a challenge, she said.

"SAN DIEGO/BALTIMORE (Reuters) - Federal Reserve policymakers who last year were frequently at odds over where to set U.S. borrowing costs opened 2020 telegraphing confidence in the state of the economy and signaling broad agreement that monetary policy is right where it should be. ,In their first remarks in the new year, heads of several regional Fed banks noted a strong job market, robust consumer spending and a rising optimism for a resolution to the trade tensions that had nicked growth in the second half of 2019.  ,And after cutting interest rates three times last year to bring the Fed's target to a range of 1.5% to 1.75% and ensure global headwinds didn't short-circuit the longest U.S. economic expansion in history, ""I think most of us think that we are well-calibrated now,"" Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank President Loretta Mester said in an interview on the sidelines of an economics conference in San Diego.  ,Based on forecasts of her fellow policymakers on the Fed's rate-setting committee, she said, ""the committee thinks a flat path (for interest rates)... is appropriate."" ,Mester had been among a handful of Fed policymakers who argued last year that the U.S. economy did not need lower rates to continue to grow.  ,And while she and others noted the outlook could change if an outside shock like this week's dramatic escalation of tensions between the United States and Iran knocks the U.S. economy off its current trajectory, most appear happy to leave rates where they are. ,""The economy is still healthy,"" Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin said earlier Friday in Baltimore. Like Mester, Barkin had been skeptical of last year's rate cuts. ""I'm encouraged by recent jobs reports and the pace of holiday spending,"" with last year's round of three Fed rate cuts helping prop up demand for homes, cars and other big-ticket consumer items, Barkin added.  ,It was an assessment also shared by Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Charles Evans who unlike Barkin and Mester supported last year's interest-rate cuts. In a CNBC interview, Evans predicted U.S. economic growth this year would chug along at a rate of 2% to 2.25%, roughly the pace of expansion in the second half of last year. ,The clutch of comments on Friday shows how comfortable most Fed policymakers are that the 2019 rate cuts will prove a sufficient buffer against the risks that spurred them into providing the stimulus, including slowing global growth and escalating trade tensions.  ,Indeed, after a fractious year for the Fed, which saw split votes on each of the rate cuts, officials agreed unanimously in their final policy meeting of 2019 to leave rates unchanged. Moreover, they agreed rates were likely to stay on hold for ""a time"" as long as the economy remains on track, minutes of the Dec. 10-11 meeting released on Friday showed. ,""Participants judged that it would be appropriate to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate,"" according to the minutes. ,Even with their newfound consensus over the outlook for rates and the economy, there were some signs of tensions that could divide Fed policymakers as the year progresses.  ,Inflation has been running below the Fed's 2% target, and that is worrying some policymakers including San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly. ,""We are seeing some early evidence that long run inflation expectations are slipping,"" Daly said at the annual American Economics Association meeting in San Diego. ""We don't have a really good understanding of why it's been so difficult to get inflation back up. ,Speaking at the same panel, Dallas Fed bank chief Robert Kaplan downplayed the danger of low inflation, noting that it is only a few tenths of a percentage point below the Fed's target. At the same time he noted his worry that low rates could feed excesses in the financial system.  ,Mester, in her interview, took a similar stance. ""I don't see anything right now that suggests to me inflation is going to run away on the top side,"" she said.

"ISTANBUL/TOKYO (Reuters) - A Turkish private jet operator said on Friday that ex-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn used two of its planes illegally in his escape from Japan, with an employee falsifying lease records to exclude his name from the documents. ,MNG Jet said it had filed a criminal complaint over the incident, a day after Turkish police detained seven people, including four pilots, as part of an investigation into Ghosn's passage through Istanbul en route to Lebanon.  ,Ghosn has become an international fugitive after he revealed on Tuesday he had fled to Lebanon to escape what he called a ""rigged"" justice system in Japan, where he faces charges relating to alleged financial crimes. ,Lebanon on Thursday received an Interpol arrest warrant for Ghosn, whose surprise escape from his home in Tokyo to a separate home in Beirut has not been fully explained.  ,The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that the diminutive Ghosn slipped out of Japan aboard a private jet hidden in a large black case typically used to carry audio gear. He was accompanied by a pair of men with names matching those of American security contractors, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with Turkey's probe into the escape. ,Japanese public broadcaster NHK, citing investigative sources, said a surveillance camera captured the former Nissan Motor Co chairman leaving his Tokyo residence alone shortly before his escape.  ,The security footage was taken by a camera installed at his house in central Tokyo around noon on Sunday, and the camera did not show him returning home, NHK said.  ,By early Monday, he had touched down in Istanbul. ,MNG Jet said in its statement it leased two jets to two different clients in agreements that ""were seemingly not connected to each other.""

"TOKYO (Reuters) - Ousted Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn left his Tokyo residence after a private security firm hired by Nissan Motor Co stopped monitoring him, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Saturday. ,Ghosn has become an international fugitive after he revealed on Tuesday he had fled to Lebanon to escape what he called a ""rigged"" justice system in Japan, where he faces charges relating to alleged financial crimes. ,Nissan had hired a private security company to watch Ghosn, who was on bail and awaiting trial, to check whether he met any people involved in the case, the three sources said. ,But his lawyers warned the security company to stop watching him as it would be a violation of his human rights, and Ghosn was planning to file a complaint against the company, the sources said.  ,The security company stopped its surveillance by Dec. 29, the sources said. ,One of his lawyers, Junichiro Hironaka, told reporters in November that they were considering steps to prevent people from stalking Ghosn.  ,A Nissan spokesperson declined to comment. ,Japanese public broadcaster NHK, citing investigative sources, said a surveillance camera placed by the authorities in Ghosn's home showed him leaving alone around noon on Sunday, and did not show him returning. ,It is unclear how Ghosn, who holds French, Brazilian and Lebanese citizenship, was able to orchestrate his departure from Japan. He entered Lebanon legally on a French passport, one source has told Reuters. ,A Turkish private jet operator said on Friday that Ghosn used two of its planes illegally in his escape from Japan, with an employee falsifying lease records to exclude his name from the documents. ,Ghosn has said he will speak publicly about his escape on Jan. 8. ,Takashi Takano, who is also one of Ghosn's lawyers, wrote in his blog on Saturday that he felt infuriated and betrayed when he found out about Ghosn's escape from Japan but that he felt some understanding.  ,""I was betrayed. But it is not Carlos Ghosn who betrayed me,"" he wrote in his blog.  ,Takano said Ghosn was not allowed to communicate with his wife Carole without permission and the ex-Nissan boss was also concerned about his chances of getting a fair trial. ,On Dec. 24, Ghosn and his wife held a one-hour video call, which required a lawyer's presence, and they talked about their children, relatives and friends, Takano wrote. Takano was present during the video call. ,Few people would have been able to escape as Ghosn did, but if they had the means and contacts, they certainly might try or at least consider trying, Takano wrote.     ,Ghosn was first arrested in Tokyo in November 2018, shortly after his private jet touched down at the airport.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exchange-traded funds that use leverage to offer double or triple the daily return of benchmark U.S. stock indexes rank  among the 10 top-performing funds of the decade, with returns that in some cases neared 2,000%, despite warnings that they are not suitable for most investors.  ,The huge gains for leveraged ETFs reflect the benefits of betting on growth during the longest bull market in history. But they also highlight the subtle ways in which record-low volatility bolstered investors.  ,High volatility hurts leveraged ETFs by adding costs to the daily rebalancing trades necessary to maintain leverage. ,Fund experts and analysts caution that the outsized returns for leveraged funds may not be repeated in the decade ahead.  ,""This was virtually the perfect decade. You had very low volatility, very low borrowing costs, and above-average market returns,"" said William Trainor, a professor at East Tennessee State University who specializes in the study of leveraged ETFs.  ,While leveraged funds will outperform other options in the decade ahead, Trainor said, rising borrowing costs over the next 3 to 4 years will likely weigh on possible gains. ,""I don't think we will see the returns that we've seen again,"" he said.  ,The Direxion Daily Technology Bull 3X ETF (,), for instance, returned nearly 1,920% between the start of 2010 through November of this year, according to Morningstar data, the biggest gain among the roughly 10,000 mutual funds and ETFs available in the United States.

Since 2016 he has led the industry's watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority. ,Finance minister Sajid Javid called him ""the stand-out candidate"" as Britain maps out its future outside the EU, and he hailed Bailey's role in quelling the 2008-09 crisis. ,""It is a tribute to his integrity and his character that he emerged from that... with his reputation enhanced in Whitehall, in the City of London and in financial capitals,"" Javid said. ,Bailey, who has sought to present a neutral stance on Brexit, said he was honored to succeed Mark Carney ""particularly at such a critical time for the nation as we leave the European Union."" ,Britain had delayed the appointment since 2018 as it focused on its tortuous EU departure and on an election emphatically won last week by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. ,Bailey was an early front-runner for the job but as the announcement was pushed back, his chances seemed to have dimmed, with his critics accusing him of pulling his punches at the FCA. ,Supporters say he knows how to use the BoE's sweeping powers without alienating bankers, and his financial crisis role makes him familiar to top officials at other major central banks. ,""When he was in the room you were confident you had someone who was worth listening to and, importantly, also had the solution to what the problem might be,"" a former official involved in the crisis said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ,The 60-year-old will serve an eight-year term starting on March 16. Carney has delayed his scheduled Jan. 31 departure until then.  ,Bailey beat other candidates recently seen as more likely to get the BoE's top job - and its 495,000 pounds a year - including another former deputy governor, Minouche Shafik, who now heads the London School of Economics. ,The Financial Times said Johnson rejected Shafik because of her critical views on Brexit. ,Bailey is viewed as pro-European but routinely starts his speeches by saying the FCA takes no position on Brexit. He has also said Britain, home to Europe's largest financial center, must not become a ""taker"" of EU rules after it leaves the bloc. ,Bailey ""should be an appointment that is above the political fray... a good choice, a steady choice,"" said Nomura economist George Buckley. ,Bailey's ousted FCA predecessor Martin Wheatley had a reputation for plain speaking, leading to suggestions that then finance minister George Osborne forced him out to appoint someone less confrontational. ,On Bailey's watch, the FCA last year fined Jes Staley, chief executive of Barclays, 1.1 million pounds ($1.43 million) after he tried to identify a whistleblower. Lawmakers said the penalty was too lenient. ,Bailey has also been criticized for not publishing in full a report into alleged misconduct by another British bank, RBS. He cited privacy restrictions. ,His chances of getting the BoE job were seen to have been further dented with the suspension of the Woodford equity fund, popular with retail clients who now face large losses. ,Prominent anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller, who works for wealth management firm SCM Direct, accused Bailey of being too slow to stop the rot at Woodford. ,""If you look at all the things on his watch, the culture has been to do things at the very last minute,"" she said. ,Bailey has said the FCA's actions were limited by EU rules. ,Born in the central English city of Leicester, his father was a school headmaster and his mother a magistrate ""so it's no surprise I ended up like this,"" he told the Sunday Times in 2016, laughing at his low-key style which stands in contrast to the high-profile approach of Carney. ,""Andrew Bailey doesn't immediately make one think of Che Guevara,"" Sam Woods, a BoE deputy governor, said in 2016. ""But Andrew has been right at the forefront of the revolution in prudential regulation."" ,Opposition Labour Party finance head John McDonnell called Bailey ""an establishment figure with what some consider is a less than inspiring record"" and said he would have to show quickly he could tackle Britain's economic problems. ,Bailey helped the BoE contain fallout from the 1995 collapse of investment bank Barings and was private secretary to former governor Eddie George in the second half of the 1990s, when the BoE was given operational independence to set rates. ,That experience should help Bailey counter questions about his lack of experience on monetary policy. He could also take advice from his American wife, Cheryl Schonhardt-Bailey, an author and editor of several books on monetary policy and trade.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer was looking forward to some holiday peace and quiet after wrapping up trade deals with the United States' most important trading partners - China, Mexico, and Canada - last week.  ,Instead, the long-standing member of President Donald Trump's inner circle who normally eschews public appearances found himself doing wall-to-wall interviews, scrambling to correct a misunderstanding with the Mexican government and taking heat from his fellow Republicans in Congress. ,The conservative Wall Street Journal carried an opinion piece that said the Trump administration had bowed to ""politically managed trade"" in agreeing to Democratic demands to revamp the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), while former USTR officials and investment analysts panned the Phase 1 U.S.-China trade deal as falling far short of expectations. ,Lighthizer, 72, is an anomaly in today's hyper-partisan Washington, a powerful member of Trump's White House who has won sometimes grudging praise from Democrats and Republicans, while keeping the ear and respect of the president throughout.      ,The USTR chief was ""the most present person from this administration that I have seen in my three years in Congress,"" said U.S. Representative Jimmy Panetta, a Democrat. ""He was all over the place, and I think that helped out quite a bit."" ,Richard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO labor union, whose support for USMCA was critical to ensuring congressional backing, called Lighthizer ""an honorable man,"" adding, ""I've worked with him for 35, 40 years, and we've always been able to work deals out because I know when he tells me something, it's good."" ,The USMCA, which will replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the China trade deal were two of Trump's top priorities, and landing them both in the same week was a public relations triumph.  ,But the efforts to reel in those deals took longer and proved harder than expected, and triggered further questions. ,Critics say some of that is a byproduct of Lighthizer's tight-fisted negotiating style. Congressional sources and former U.S. government officials say he is always well-prepared, but can appear arrogant and unwilling to delegate. ,Lighthizer is also prone to slamming down the phone in anger, Representative Richard Neal, the Democratic chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee, told reporters last week. ,Tasked with resetting the main U.S. trading relationships in the world to reflect the Trump administration's conviction that the United States has been taken advantage of for years, Lighthizer has taken to the job like a duck to water.  ,There is little daylight between Trump and the Georgetown University-educated Ohio native on the key planks of an ""America First"" policy that is aimed at rebalancing the global trading arena in favor of U.S. workers and companies. ,Lighthizer, who was a deputy trade negotiator in the Reagan administration in the 1980s, honed his views during a lengthy career as a private international trade lawyer. Among his clients were U.S. steel companies struggling to compete against heavily subsidized imports from China.  ,He ""understands the president better than most,"" and wants to significantly change the way trade is done, a veteran U.S. trade negotiator said on condition of anonymity. ,Dismantling the World Trade Organization, moving away from multilateral trade agreements and using steel and aluminum tariffs to punish countries accused of hurting U.S. industry are policies Lighthizer accepts, the source said.  ,But it's his negotiating style as well as that of others in the Trump administration that has generated much criticism. ,The Trump trade team often refuses to commit negotiations to paper while discussions are underway, according to multiple congressional sources, and Lighthizer, unlike his predecessors, has clamped down on background conversations with reporters. ,That can lead to misunderstandings and confusion.  ,For instance, Lighthizer insists the first phase of the U.S.-China trade deal is completely ""done,"" but Beijing has not confirmed details , released by U.S. officials, leaving markets and key affected industrial sectors befuddled.  ,It could be weeks before the 86-page agreement is translated into Chinese and further details are released.  ,Several Chinese officials this week said the wording of the deal remained a delicate issue and care was needed to ensure expressions used in text did not re-escalate tensions, raising concerns it could still unravel. ,Jorge Guajardo, a former Mexican ambassador to China who is now a senior director at McLarty Associates, said both the dust-up with the Mexicans over U.S. plans to monitor changes to Mexican labor rules, and the delayed release of the text of the China deal raised questions about how Lighthizer operated.  ,""Both Mexico and China seem to have been caught off guard,"" Guajardo said. ""It's troubling. It does indicate a bit of a pattern on the U.S. side of presenting different agreements than their parties think they agreed to."" ,Harry Broadman, a former senior USTR official, said there was no reason the Mexico issue should have spilled into public view. Announcing the trade deal with China before the text was translated was also unusual, he said. ,""That is not the procedure usually followed in trade negotiations worldwide. Usually you speak after you have something in writing, and both sides release it,"" Broadman said. ,An apologetic Lighthizer, speaking on Fox Business Network on Tuesday, said the Mexico situation was a ""last-minute snag"" and ""a misunderstanding ... that was easily taken care of."" ,Lighthizer also came under fire from fellow Republicans for dropping a 10-year data protection provision for certain pharmaceuticals from USMCA. ,U.S. Senator Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican and fierce USMCA critic, said on Thursday it was a major setback for a ""very, very exciting new category of medicines"" and would make it harder for U.S. drug makers to recoup heavy investment costs. ,Lighthizer conceded on Fox Business Network it ""was a step backwards"" but said it was a needed compromise to ensure congressional support from the Democratic-controlled House. ,Ultimately, Trump was the one who wanted to get the China deal done ahead of Dec. 15, when a new set of tariffs were due to kick in, said Christian Whiton, a fellow at the Center for the National Interest think tank in Washington and a member of Trump's transition team after the 2016 election.   ,At the end of the day, ""Lighthizer is a lawyer and Trump is his client,"" Whiton said. Under pressure to get a deal done ""it is entirely possible (Lighthizer) came back with something that is half-baked,"" he said.  ,Lighthizer, battling laryngitis, briefed reporters about the U.S.-China trade deal on Dec. 13. He conceded there was hard work ahead and that its success was up to China, adding that he had Trump's backing. ,""The deal's done when the deal's done,"" he said. ""I would walk away on a matter of significance absolutely a minute before (it's done), and the important thing is that everybody knows it. And I know the president would – so I don't have to worry about that."" ,Already, he's gearing up for the next trade battle in Europe, over aircraft subsidies, digital tax plans and the Geneva-based WTO. ""I live in a target-rich environment, so there's a lot to do,"" he quipped. ",Business News,12/20/2019 6:12,Two deals in pocket but no holiday cheer for U.S. trade chief Lighthizer

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing applications for unemployment benefits dropped from a more than two-year high last week, pointing to sustained labor market strength that should continue to underpin consumer spending and the economy. ,While other data on Thursday showed factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region almost stalling this month, manufacturers received more orders, increased shipments and boosted hours for employees. Their outlook for capital expenditure over the next six months was also upbeat, offering some tentative signs of stabilization in manufacturing amid an easing in tensions in the 17-month trade war between the United States and China. ,The trade tensions have bruised business confidence and weighed on capital expenditure, leading to a downturn in national manufacturing activity. But a turnaround in manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the economy, could be delayed. Boeing announced on Monday it would suspend production of its best-selling 737 MAX jetliner in January as fallout from two fatal crashes of the now-grounded aircraft drags into 2020.  ,Economists estimated that Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years, which is expected to wreak havoc on supply chains, could cut first-quarter 2020 gross domestic product growth by at least half a percentage point. ,""The economy isn't going off the rails here,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ""But at the same time, it isn't setting any land speed records."" ,Initial claims for state unemployment benefits decreased 18,000 to a seasonally adjusted 234,000 for the week ended Dec. 14, the Labor Department said.  ,The drop, which only partially unwound the prior week's jump of 49,000, likely does not indicate a material shift in labor market conditions as claims data tend to be volatile in the period following the Thanksgiving Day holiday.  ,The surge in the week ended Dec. 7, which boosted claims to 252,000 - the highest reading since September 2017 - probably reflected a late Thanksgiving Day this year compared to 2018. That could have thrown off the model used by the government to strip out seasonal fluctuations from the data. ,Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims would fall to 225,000 in the latest week. They expect claims to remain elevated relative to October's low reading given volatility in the data around the holiday season and end of the year. ,""At this point we are not concerned about the rise in initial claims and view it as a statistical quirk related to the seasonal adjustment process around Thanksgiving,"" said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York. ,A second report on Thursday from the National Association of Realtors showed existing home sales dropped 1.7% in November. Home resales, however, increased 2.7% from a year ago. The solid labor market and low mortgage rates are driving demand for housing. ,The dollar was steady against a basket currencies, while prices for longer-dated U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher. Financial markets were unmoved by the impeachment late on Wednesday of President Donald Trump, who is unlikely to be removed from office. ,The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, rose 1,500 to 225,500 last week - still consistent with a strong labor market. ,Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of December's employment report.  ,The four-week moving average of claims rose 4,250 between the November and December survey periods, suggesting some cooling in job growth. The economy added 266,000 jobs in November, the most in 10 months. The unemployment rate fell back to 3.5%, the lowest in nearly half a century.  ,Labor market strength is supporting consumer spending, keeping the economy on a moderate growth path despite headwinds from the trade tensions and slowing global growth. ,In a third report on Thursday, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve said its business conditions index dropped to a reading of 0.3 in December from 10.4 in November. But there were increases in measures of new orders, unfilled orders, factory hours and shipments.  ,While manufacturers reported paying higher prices for raw materials and other inputs, they appeared unable to pass on the higher costs to consumers in a significant way.    ,The Philadelphia Fed survey's six-month business conditions index slipped to a reading of 35.2 this month from 35.8 in November. Its six-month capital expenditures index jumped to 27.6 from a reading of 19.4 in the prior month. ,The mixed readings in manufacturing in the region that covers eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware mirror other measures on factory activity.  ,A survey from the New York Fed on Monday showed its business conditions index remaining subdued for the seventh consecutive month. Manufacturers were, however, optimistic about business conditions over the next six months.  ,""They (surveys) show little clear sign of the pronounced rebound in sentiment that we had hoped to see after recent developments on trade policy and strength in risky asset markets, but they have also shown little sign of further deterioration,"" said Jesse Edgerton, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.

"LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - Agreements that let Facebook and other firms send European citizens' data to the United States and other countries are valid, a key EU court adviser said on Thursday, although he left room for such transfers to be blocked if European data protection standards are not met in countries receiving the information. ,The case is based on a challenge by Austrian privacy activist Max Schrems, who argued that Facebook's contracts do not protect data to European levels, especially given concerns about activities by U.S. spy agencies. ,Schrems had also called on Ireland, where Facebook has its European headquarters, to act against the company because it is subjected to U.S. surveillance laws, which he believes could threaten Europeans' rights. ,Schrems successfully fought against the EU's previous 'Safe Harbour' privacy rules in 2015. ,Henrik Saugmandsgaard Øe, advocate general (AG) at the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), said the agreements used by many companies including Facebook to underpin activities such as outsourced services, cloud infrastructure, data hosting and finance are legal. ,The court, which follows such recommendations in four out of five cases, will rule in the coming months. ,However, he added privacy regulators must prohibit such data transfer when laws of the countries receiving the data, such as the United States, conflict with the data protection requirements of the agreements, known as standard contractual clauses.  ,Schrems said he was ""generally happy"" with the legal opinion. ,""Everyone will still be able to have all necessary data flows with the U.S., like sending emails or booking a hotel in the U.S.,"" he said.  ,""Some EU businesses may not be able to use certain U.S. providers for outsourcing anymore, because US surveillance laws requires these companies to disclose data to the National Security Agency (NSA).""  ,""It is really upon the United States to ensure baseline privacy protections for foreigners. Otherwise no one will trust U.S. companies with their data."" ,The opinion calls into question the sufficiency of U.S. data protections, said Caitlin Fennessy, research director at the International Association of Privacy Professionals. ,""This suggests a near-term diplomatic solution will be critical,"" she said. ,Facebook said in a statement, ""We are grateful for the Advocate General's opinion on these complex questions. Standard Contractual Clauses provide important safeguards to ensure that Europeans' data are protected once transferred overseas. SCCs have been designed and endorsed by the European Commission and enable thousands of Europeans to do business worldwide."" ,The court should follow the adviser's opinion on the clauses, said Patrick Van Eecke, global chair of law firm DLA Piper's data protection practice. ,""In an open and global economy which is highly dependent of data flows crossing the national borders of countries or regions, putting up hurdles prohibiting international data transfers is not good for business and not good for people either,"" he said.  ,Ireland's Data Protection Commission, Facebook's lead regulator in the EU, welcomed the advocate general's opinion noting that it ""illustrates the levels of complexity associated with the kinds of issues that arise when EU data protection laws interact with the laws of third countries, to include the laws of the United States. ,The case is C-311/18 Facebook Ireland and Schrems.

"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - Boeing Co (,) is set to launch its new astronaut capsule on Friday on its first unmanned journey to the International Space Station, a milestone test for the U.S. aerospace firm that is vying with SpaceX to revive NASA's human spaceflight capabilities. ,Boeing's CST-100 Starliner spacecraft, a cone-shaped pod capable of carrying up to seven astronauts, will blast off from Florida's Cape Canaveral around 6:36 a.m. local time (1136 GMT), atop an Atlas V rocket from Boeing-Lockheed Martin Corp's (,) United Launch Alliance.  ,Minutes after liftoff, Starliner will detach from the main rocket booster for a rendezvous some 254 miles (409 km) into space the following morning with the International Space Station.  ,The test is one of the most daunting milestones required by NASA's Commercial Crew Program to certify the capsule for eventual human spaceflight - a long-delayed goal set back years by development hurdles from both Boeing and SpaceX. ,Despite the delays, and a blistering November government watchdog report that found Boeing received an ""unnecessary"" contract boost from NASA, a successful mission would hand Boeing an engineering and public relations win in a year punctuated by a corporate crisis over a ban on its 737 MAX jetliner following fatal crashes. ,Boeing was awarded $4.2 billion and Elon Musk's SpaceX $2.5 billion in 2014 to develop separate capsule systems capable of ferrying astronauts to the space station from American soil for the first time since the U.S. Space Shuttle was retired from service in 2011. ,The program, primarily meant to end America's sole reliance on Russia's space program for rides to the space station, had initially expected its first crewed flights on Starliner and SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule in late 2017, though a slew of design and safety concerns for both vehicles have led to schedule delays. ,The current target date for the first crewed flight is planned for mid-2020 for Boeing and SpaceX. ,Occupying one of Starliner's astronaut seats will be a mannequin named Rosie, outfitted with sensors to measure the pressure a real astronaut would endure on ascent to the space station and during hypersonic re-entry back through Earth's atmosphere, Boeing told reporters during pre-launch briefings. ,Starliner will stay at the space station for a week before undocking and beginning its return to Earth early on Dec. 28, deploying three parachutes to slow its descent to the desert surface of White Sands, New Mexico, Boeing said. ,SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule carried out its unmanned test flight to the space station in March.

"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Chinese automakers Great Wall Motor (,) and Changan Automobile (,) are accelerating plans to build cars in India after the initial success of rival SAIC Motor (,) in one of the world's biggest markets, three sources said. ,Great Wall, one of the biggest sellers of sports-utility vehicles (SUV) in China, expects to secure a production site in the first half of 2020, likely a General Motors (,) plant in Maharashtra, a source familiar with Great Wall's plans said.  ,Buying a factory is seen as the best way to get up and running fast and Great Wall is finalizing which SUVs it plans to make in India, including whether to kick off its launch with an electric SUV, the source told Reuters. ,Great Wall said it would make an announcement next month about its plans for India but declined further comment. ,A spokesman for GM in Detroit said it was continuing to make vehicles for export at its Talegaon plant in Maharashtra state. ,""As we have said previously, we continue to explore options to improve utilization of the plant. We do not comment on speculation,"" he said. ,Changan, too, is scouting for a production base and has held initial talks with suppliers, sources aware of its plans said. Both automakers, which produce electric vehicles (EVs) in China, are also considering whether to set up EV battery assembly plants in India, the sources said. ,Changan declined to comment. ,The companies see India as a chance to combat slowing sales at home, which fell in November for a 17th month in a row. While car sales in India are stuttering, the market is expected to become the world's third biggest by 2026, behind China and the United States, according to consultancy LMC Automotive ,The Chinese firms also hope to capitalize on gaps left by global automakers such as Fiat Chrysler (,), Ford Motor (,) and GM which have scaled back plans in a market still dominated by smaller, low-cost cars made by Maruti Suzuki (,) and Hyundai Motor (,). ,""It is an opportune time for China's automakers to enter India. There is currently a gap in competition and it may take a couple of years for some of the established carmakers to bring new products to the market,"" said LMC Automotive's Ammar Master. ,GM's retreat from India, for example, could help Great Wall get going quickly and it has been in talks to buy GM's plant in Maharashtra, two of the sources said. ,GM stopped selling cars in India in 2017 and has already sold its other plant in Gujarat to SAIC, where the state-owned Chinese automaker now makes the Hector SUV it launched in June under its MG Motor brand. ,India is part of Great Wall's planned global expansion into South America, South Africa, Southeast Asia and Australia, and it also plans to export from their to places such as Europe and the United States, said the source who is aware of its plans. ,""The plant in India is expected to be the biggest for Great Wall outside of China,"" the source said. ,Great Wall has hired a former executive from Maruti Suzuki, India's biggest carmaker, for its product and business planning, and appointed a former executive from SAIC's India division as a consultant to liaise with the government.  ,""For global automakers, India is one of the many markets they are in but for the Chinese it is the first major market outside of home and so the level of investment and commitment will be proportionately high,"" said the source. ,One of the biggest hurdles in India will be fighting perceptions about the quality and reliability of Chinese products and winning over brand-conscious buyers for whom cars are a prestige statement, say analysts.  ,Chinese smartphone makers such as Xiaomi Corp (,) faced similar perception issues when they launched in India but they now dominate the market. However, cars remain a significant outlay for most Indians and the Chinese brands will need to make their mark quickly. ,""Once the likes of Volkswagen (,) and Ford start launching new models in India, the entrants from China could face tougher competition because a lot of buyers in India are still very brand conscious,"" said LMC's Master.  ,Still, the initial success of SAIC's Hector SUV has helped. Launched at the end of June it said it had sold more than 13,000 cars by the end of November and plans to sell 24,000 next year. ,""SAIC has changed the perception about whether a Chinese brand can be made and sold in India,"" said Santosh Pai, partner at law firm Link Legal which advises Chinese companies setting up in India. ""Fence sitters are getting in and have realized they can sell in India if the price and strategy is right."" ,Lessons for Great Wall and Changan from SAIC's India launch include marketing the brand aggressively, packing the car with features to differentiate it from rivals and giving extended warranties to dispel doubts over reliability, analysts say.  ,Another advantage for Chinese carmakers in the coming years will be their EV expertise. With the sale of EVs slowing in China they can deploy some of their existing capacity to India where the government is encouraging clean fuel cars. ,SAIC, which will soon launch an electric SUV in India, is also scouting for a second manufacturing site and is expected to make a decision in early 2020, said a source aware of its plans. ,SAIC did not respond to a request for comment though the head of its Indian division said in November it was working on an expansion plan and expected its total sales in India to hit 70,000 in 2021. ,Graphic: Car sales growth in India vs China - , ",Business News,12/20/2019 0:44,China's Great Wall revs up for India as rivals hit the brakes

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The new North American trade deal addresses most concerns of U.S. labor unions, Richard Trumka, head of the AFL-CIO union federation, said on Thursday, but even so he expects it could take more than a decade to reverse job losses resulting from the original 25-year-old trade pact. ,Trumka, the head of the largest federation of U.S. unions, told Reuters he remained skeptical that Mexico - a low-wage country compared with the United States - would implement the labor reforms it has promised. ,But he praised the revised U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) that was passed by the Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives earlier on Thursday as a major improvement over the original pact signed by President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Canada last year. The pact, which must be ratified by lawmakers in all three countries, still needs to be voted on by the Republican-majority U.S. Senate, where easy passage is expected. ,House Democrats had insisted on changes to the original USMCA pact, as labor unions pressed for changes that they said were needed to protect jobs.  ,Trumka played a make-or-break role in getting the deal passed and locking in the support of Democratic lawmakers. It is the first major trade deal backed by the AFL-CIO, a federation of 55 unions representing 12.5 million workers, since 2000. Trumka calls it just a first step for undoing the damage of North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that went into effect in 1994 under Democratic President Bill Clinton.  ,""This isn't a perfect agreement; it still has room for improvement. But it is well on its way to getting there,"" Trumka said in an interview. ""It's going to take a few years to begin to reverse the bad and the evil that was done by NAFTA, the harm that was done to our economy and to the manufacturing sector."" ,He said it could take eight to 12 years to reverse the loss of manufacturing jobs triggered by the original free trade deal. ,Automotive jobs were a linchpin issue of the deal. ,The AFL-CIO estimates the United States has lost 851,700 jobs to Mexico because of NAFTA. The U.S. goods trade deficit with Mexico was $80.7 billion in 2018, compared with a $1.7 billion surplus in 1993, thanks in part to U.S. companies moving manufacturing operations south of the border. ,Pushback from unions and Democrats over the trade deal agreed by the Trump administration, Mexico and Canada in September 2018 resulted in a revamp that included beefed-up labor and environment provisions, new enforcement mechanisms, and reduced patent protections that some feared would drive up drug prices. ,Trumka, a third-generation coal miner, said it was imperative that unions and others hold the Mexican government accountable for workers' rights. ,""It will take work. If we don't keep on our toes and enforce the agreement and use the agreement till its utmost, it will not have the effect that it should have,"" Trumka said. ,The final piece of the deal came together on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, Trumka said, while he was on a family trip hunting deer in Pennsylvania. Mexico agreed to allow any worker or union to trigger an investigation if they believe Mexican workers' rights, including pay and safety standards, are being violated.  ,""When we're successful, we can stop their product from coming into the United States, it stops at the border,"" Trumka said. ,Mexican auto workers earn average hourly wages of less than $6 excluding benefits, compared with about $28 in the United States, the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Michigan, reported , in 2017. Under the USMCA, 40% to 45% of vehicle content must come from areas paying more than $16 an hour.  ,Trumka noted that Trump may take credit for the USMCA's gains for workers.  ,Trump, who won the 2016 election with victories in states like Michigan that had long been a union stronghold, had made a renegotiation of NAFTA a key policy issue, and like labor unions blamed NAFTA for a loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs. ,But according to Trumka, American workers were running out of patience with the president, given widening gaps between rich and poor, and a raft of Trump's ""anti-worker"" actions, including rollbacks on safety regulations and moves to weaken the National Labor Relations Board. ,""When you balance the scale out,(Trump) comes up on the short end,"" Trumka said. ,He said the AFL-CIO would push for significant changes to Trump's tax law that slashed corporate taxes, and a reversal of Citizens United, a Supreme Court decision that he said had given corporations more rights than people, corrupting the political process.

Trump vowed for years to quit or renegotiate NAFTA, which he blames for the loss of thousands of U.S. factories to low-wage Mexico. ,House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gave USMCA a green light last week after striking a deal with the Trump administration, Canada and Mexico to strengthen labor enforcement provisions and eliminate some drug patent protections. ,U.S. industry groups breathed a sigh of relief at the vote.  ,""House passage of the USMCA is a huge step toward finalizing this long-awaited 21st century trade agreement,"" said Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents Detroit automakers Ford (,), General Motors (,) and Fiat Chrysler (,). ,""This modernized trade deal between our North American trading partners will strengthen the U.S. auto industry and the auto manufacturing supply chain,"" Blunt added. ,The changes negotiated by Democrats, which include modestly tighter environmental rules, will also set up a mechanism to quickly investigate labor rights abuses at Mexican factories.  ,The endorsement of these provisions by U.S. labor leader Richard Trumka, head of the AFL-CIO, was considered crucial to winning support from Democrats, who control the House. ,""This isn't a perfect agreement. It still has room for improvement,"" Trumka told Reuters in an interview, adding it could take eight to 12 years to begin reversing U.S. job losses. ,U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer made a concession by dropping a requirement for 10 years of data exclusivity for biologic drugs, a provision that Democrats feared would keep drug prices high and that they called a ""giveaway"" to big drugmakers. ,But those changes were not enough for some rust-belt Democrats to overcome the scars from factory closures blamed on NAFTA over the past 26 years. ,""USMCA will not bring back the 155,000 jobs in Ohio that were lost to outsourcing after NAFTA,"" Representative Marcy Kaptur said of her home state in explaining her ""no"" vote. ,""It does nothing for our small farmers suffering under President Trump's trade wars, and it holds no true labor protections that the Mexican government is capable of enforcing,"" Kaptur said in a statement. ,Representative Ron Kind, a pro-trade Democrat from Wisconsin, one of the top dairy-producing states, praised new access to Canada's closed dairy market under USMCA.  ,""A no vote is a return to the failed policy of the old NAFTA, the status quo, rather than this more modernized version,"" Kind said in floor debate.  ,The U.S. International Trade Commission estimated in April that USMCA would modestly boost the U.S. economy, adding 176,000 jobs over 15 years but may reduce vehicle assembly in the United States. It would boost economic output by 0.35% a year, or $68.5 billion annually versus a NAFTA baseline.  ,The agreement modernizes NAFTA, adding language that preserves the U.S. model for internet, digital services and e-commerce development, industries that did not exist when NAFTA was negotiated in the early 1990s. It eliminates some food safety barriers to U.S. farm products and contains language prohibiting currency manipulation for the first time in a trade agreement. ,But the biggest changes require increased North American content in cars and trucks built in the region, to 75% from 62.5% in NAFTA, with new mandates to use North American steel and aluminum.   ,In addition, 40% to 45% of vehicle content must come from high-wage areas paying more than $16 an hour - namely the United States and Canada. Some vehicles assembled in Mexico mainly with components from Mexico and outside the region may not qualify for U.S. tariff-free access. ,""We're going forward. Good news,"" Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said on Twitter after the House vote, which caused the Mexican peso to strengthen slightly to 18.91 to the dollar. For nearly three years, the peso has risen and fallen  on news about NAFTA negotiations. ,Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told CBC television that Canada's Parliament would approve USMCA ""as quickly as we can."" But Parliament is not scheduled to return to Ottawa before Jan. 27. ",Business News,12/19/2019 17:39,"U.S. House passes new North American trade deal, Senate timing unclear"
"(Reuters) - The general counsel of a U.S. labor agency has accused Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc of violating U.S. labor law by allegedly firing an employee in New York in retaliation for complaining about workplace problems and trying to organize with a union. ,The office of the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) filed the complaint on Dec. 12. The union involved, 32BJ, which is trying to organize workers at the Mexican fast-casual restaurant chain, received a copy of the complaint on Thursday. ,Because Chipotle's restaurants are all owned by the corporation as a single employer, it is an easier target for union organizers than fast-food giant McDonald's Corp, most of whose locations are owned and operated by franchisees. ,Chipotle spokespeople did not provide an immediate response to requests for comment. ,The NLRB's general counsel, Peter Robb, alleged in the complaint that a manager at a restaurant in Manhattan in May threatened to fire employees if they engaged in union activities - even implying they might face physical violence - and promised promotions to other workers who provided information about the organizing. ,The complaint, which was filed with the NLRB, also alleges similar manager intimidation at another Manhattan store. One employee who complained about scheduling and other problems was fired. ,The complaint asks that Chipotle reimburse the fired employee for expenses incurred from work searches and for tax relief from any lump sum back pay awards. The complaint seeks no other remedy. ,The NLRB's general counsel operates independently from the Board and is responsible for investigating and prosecuting unfair labor practices. Robb, who has been general counsel since November 2017, was appointed by President Donald Trump. ,The parent of 32BJ, the Service Employees International Union, is involved in the Fight for $15 and a Union, which has long sought to organize workers at McDonald's. ,That effort suffered a setback of sorts last week when the full NLRB board approved McDonald's Corp's proposed settlement allowing the fast-food company to avoid a ruling on whether it is a ""joint employer"" of franchise workers and could be made to bargain with unions. ,While Fight for $15 and a Union said it would appeal, the decision suggests it may be a long road for organizers if they are not able to target the parent corporation and must instead bargain with thousands of individual U.S. owners. ,Chipotle must respond to the complaint by Dec. 26 and a hearing is set for March 2 in New York.

"LONDON (Reuters) - One of the hardiest investment fixtures has been the annual 'buy' note on emerging markets equities, but their dismal performance over the past decade begs the question why. ,With the United States and China poised to seal an initial trade deal, the chances of a global recession receding, and U.S. equities soaring to record levels, many investment firms are once again turning positive on emerging markets for 2020. ,That seems logical in a low-growth, low-yielding developed world, where underlying bullishness about equities may reasonably be guided toward relatively high dividend and growth stocks in a grouping of developing economies now accounting for around 60% of global economic activity and expected to be the main engine of what little growth there is around. ,But the re-emergence of the seasonal cheer toward emerging markets doesn't wash as easily as it once did and contrasts with the rest of the year, in which returns on emerging market stocks have disappointed - less than half those of Wall St's S&P 500 , and more than 10 percentage points below MSCI's all-country world index. ,Some bets go wrong once in a while. But it's been like this for emerging markets for much of the past decade. ,In every year apart from 2010 and 2017, the MSCI Emerging Markets Index .MSCIEF has trundled in behind the plain vanilla U.S. benchmark index, raising questions as to why advisers continually push ostensibly higher-risk markets that reap poorer returns.  ,""This time of the year, every single year, you get the same people...trotting out the same argument as to why you should buy emerging markets,"" said John-Paul Smith of emerging market consultancy Ecstrat, who has correctly called the underperformance of emerging stocks from the end of 2010. ,Once dismissed as ""casinos"" because of their volatile economics and politics and frequent illiquidity, emerging markets have sucked in an estimated $50 billion annually in foreign equity flows since that term for lower and middle-income countries was first coined 38 years ago. ,That investment has helped emerging economies develop, with at least some of that cash ploughed into infrastructure, local business and public services. ,For much of their early years, emerging markets proved the brightest stars in the global asset class galaxy - surpassing the S&P 500 up until the 2008 global financial crisis. ,But the last decade has been more subdued. ,Investors broadly give three big reasons for that. A stronger dollar, due in part to U.S. attempts to dial down stimulus in the wake of the 2008 banking crash, has acted as a headwind for further migration of still-dominant western private savings pools toward emerging markets. ,More tepid global growth has also magnified a slowdown in China - whose explosive expansion from 2000 was the supercycle of the previous decade but which has since dragged on all emerging economies. ,Thirdly, the failure of globalization to fully recover from the 2008 banking crash and recession - evident in a rash of protectionist politics, civil unrest and faltering trade - has weakened the underlying 30-year investment thesis. ,""In this environment trade has suffered,"" said Ian Hargreaves, co-head of Asia and emerging market equities at Invesco. ""Given the correlation between exports growth and corporate earnings for EM companies, this has had a negative impact."" ,Nevertheless, heading into 2020, BlackRock - the world's largest asset manager - is overweight on emerging market equities. Amundi Asset Management, Europe's largest, is ""moderately more constructive"" on the asset class. JPMorgan, the U.S.'s largest bank, is modestly overweight, while HSBC Asset Management, part of Europe's largest bank, is overweight too. ,Many within the industry were similarly positive going into 2019 and in many recent years. BlackRock and HSBC Asset Management were overweight this time last year, Amundi was neutral, while JPMorgan expected emerging market stocks to deliver double-digit appreciation - which they have done, just almost half the amount you would have got at home in Boston, London, Paris or Frankfurt. ,""The fund management industry push the emerging markets largely for reasons of self-interest because the margins are so much higher,"" said Smith.  ,For a graphic on Dismal decade for emerging market stocks, click , ,Their poor performance is raising broader questions about the structure of stock market indexes like MSCI's, the most-widely used emerging market index, with around 1,100 constituents from 26 countries. ,Such indexes should begin to encompass U.S. giants such as Boeing (,), Coca-Cola (,) or Chevron (,) as emerging markets begin to account for a larger chunk of their profits, said veteran emerging market investor Mark Mobius. Developed market stocks are not currently included, although MSCI does offer separate indexes which cover such stocks with high exposure to emerging markets. ,""You can continue to say emerging market countries are in the lower and middle-income bracket but if a company has more than 50% of its earnings in emerging markets it should be defined as an emerging market company,"" said Mobius, founding partner of Mobius Capital Partners.  ,Some emerging market companies have performed well over the past decade. South Korea's Samsung Electronics (,), for example, has shot up more than 300%, although still less than Apple (,) and Microsoft (,). ,For a graphic on Dismal decade for emerging market stocks, click , ,MSCI says its framework for classifying markets into emerging and developed is supported by evidence showing that splits based on development and geography resulted in correlation clusters, allowing investors to seek out diversity. ,""Superior economic growth has resulted in positive market returns historically, low correlation within emerging markets and across asset classes has provided diversification benefits, and relative scarcity of information has created opportunities for active portfolio management,"" said Dimitris Melas, MSCI's global head of core equity research.  ,Melas points out that emerging markets have outperformed since the launch of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index in December 1987.  ,The 80s were the start of an investment boom in emerging markets, which gained traction after the IFC's Antoine van Agtmael pitched a fund investing in such markets in a meeting at investment bank Salomon Brothers in New York. He piqued the interest of those present but doubts surfaced about the proposed name ""Third World Equity Fund,"" a term that connoted poverty and hopelessness. ,Agtmael coined emerging markets, instead. Soon the likes of Franklin Templeton and Capital Group were dipping their toes in the asset class, at the vanguard of a growing wall of investment. ,""It still makes sense to group together the lower-income end of the global investment universe and it has not stopped 'emerging',"" said Agtmael. ""In fact, it may be bigger and more attractive than ever now that it is no longer 'hyped'."" ,Emerging markets remain a growing part of the global economy with a rising middle class, unlike the U.S., he notes.  ,Fund managers are split about the asset class's fortunes over the next decade. ,Ecstrat's Smith remains downbeat, worrying in particular about the risk of a blow-up among ""too big to fail"" state-linked firms in China. ,Others are more positive. ,""In the last three months emerging markets have outperformed the S&P 500,"" said Mobius. ""We may be seeing a return to emerging markets mainly because of this low interest rate environment. People are searching for yield."" ,But if that yield is drowned by repeated capital loss, illiquidity or excessive volatility, the burden of proof will climb further.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - Deutsche Telekom was in advanced talks to retain China's Huawei as its main supplier of radio equipment for new mobile networks before it put the negotiations on hold for political reasons, according to three sources familiar with the matter. ,The United States has urged its allies to freeze out the Chinese supplier over cybersecurity concerns. Washington has told allies that the company's equipment could be used by China as spying tools, an allegation denied by Huawei and Beijing. ,Deutsche Telekom (,), Europe's largest telecoms operator, announced last week that it was not entering into 5G network equipment contracts as it awaited the resolution of a political debate in Berlin over whether to restrict Huawei's access to the German market. ,Before that announcement, Deutsche Telekom had held discussions with Huawei [HWT.UL] in Paris and hammered out terms for a possible deal, though no contract was signed, said the sources, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. ,In response to Reuters questions about talks with Huawei, a Deutsche Telekom spokesman confirmed that no deal or arrangement had been reached about making the Chinese company its main supplier of 5G network equipment. ,Before the talks were put on hold, the sources said that the two sides had discussed key terms which envisioned that Huawei would provide 70% of radio transmission gear for Deutsche Telekom's upcoming ultra-fast 5G networks for a price of 533 million euros ($587 million).  ,A mechanism was also worked out that, should Huawei's share of the 5G equipment provision fall due to any move by the Berlin government to limit Chinese involvement, the amount the company would be paid would fall proportionately, the sources said.    ,The Paris discussions took place last month, when Deutsche Telekom held talks with Huawei as well as with other potential vendors of 5G network equipment, according to the sources.  ,Subsequently, on Dec. 3, senior executives from the German and Chinese companies held a meeting at Frankfurt Airport, said the sources. Claudia Nemat, a Deutsche Telekom management board member and its top technology executive, and Huawei Deputy Chairman Eric Xu attended the meeting, they added. ,The Deutsche Telekom spokesman confirmed the meetings took place in Frankfurt and Paris but said negotiations about all transactions had been suspended while the Berlin government, which owns 32% of the telecom operator, decided on official policy regarding Huawei.  ,He added the purpose of the Dec. 3 meeting was to inform Huawei that talks were on hold.     ,Huawei declined to comment on its discussions with Deutsche Telekom. ,The talks and their subsequent suspension highlight the complexities and disruption facing carriers around the world as they try to move forward with 5G networks, which will enable much higher wireless internet speeds.   ,Huawei is the world's biggest supplier of mobile network gear, and has been used by Deutsche Telekom and many other of the world's biggest telecom operators to provide the bulk of their existing 3G and 4G network infrastructure. ,The discussions between Deutsche Telekom and Huawei covered only 5G radio gear, according to the sources, not equipment for the more sensitive network ""core"" which is the main focus of security concerns for telecoms operators and governments. ,Radio equipment consists of the antennas mounted on masts and base stations, providing mobile service coverage, while core infrastructure manages calls and data traffic across the network. ,Deutsche Telekom, Huawei's largest European customer, has not announced a decision on suppliers for its core.  ,On Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's government delayed a decision on security rules for 5G networks until next year. ,Merkel has not singled out Huawei, but some lawmakers in her coalition government have called for the Chinese company to be subject to tougher measures than others, ranging from curbing its market share to 50% to an outright ban.

"PARIS (Reuters) - French telecoms group Orange (,) and its former CEO Didier Lombard were guilty of ""moral harassment"" that prompted a spate of suicides during a restructuring at the company in the late 2000s, a Paris court ruled on Friday. ,The landmark ruling against the former telecoms monopoly is bound to reverberate in French boardrooms as it could pave the way for other similar collective procedures. ,The court sentenced Lombard to a year in jail, of which eight months will be suspended, and a 15,000 euros ($16,700) fine. Yet since that term is under two years and as Lombard does not present a danger to society, he will not spend time behind bars under French court rules.    ,The traumatic episode of workers' deaths at the company in the late 2000s led to deep soul-searching over corporate culture in France.  ,The court found Orange guilty of the same charge, and fined it 75,000 euros ($83,200). ,""In financial terms, the sentence is light, but this is the first time a French company gets a criminal conviction for moral harassment and that is very bad in terms of reputation,"" said a lawyer specializing in white-collar crime.  ,The lawyer, who declined to be named, added the ruling will be a major concern for other companies as it sets a precedent for corporate responsibility in moral harassment and employee burn-out cases.  ,Many individual managers have been convicted of harassment - and often fired as a result - but not companies themselves.  ,Orange, which in 2018 had core earnings of 3.3 billion euros  ($3.66 billion), said it would not appeal the verdict. ,Orange has previously acknowledged the suffering expressed by victims and recognized there may have been management errors in implementing the restructuring plan but denies there was any systemic plan or intention to harass employees. ,Prosecutors argued that some of the methods employed in a deep restructuring of the company, then known as France Telecom, after privatization prompted a wave of suicides.  ,Lombard, 77, and three other former Orange executives also accused of ""moral harassment"" have denied any wrongdoing and said the restructuring plan was an economic necessity. ,Orange used the last day of the trial in July to offer compensation to victims and relatives of those who died. The presiding judge estimated that claims for compensation so far were about 2 million euros ($2.25 million). ,The case centers around a drive by the former state monopoly to shed 22,000 jobs and redeploy another 10,000 as it adapted to competition in the private sector. ,In a country where workers employed on state contracts expect jobs for life and employees in both private and public sectors enjoy strong labor law protection, unions alleged that management sought ways to encourage workers to quit or accept reassignment. ,Prosecutors listed at least 18 suicides and 13 suicide attempts between April 2008 and June 2010.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Giant listings by Saudi Aramco (,) and Alibaba (,) rescued a sluggish year for equity capital markets (ECM) in 2019 after a string of shelved initial public offerings (IPOs) and share price slumps.  ,Proceeds from global equity capital markets (ECM) fell 4.7% to $659 billion in 2019, according to Refinitiv data, a figure propped up by state-owned oil giant Aramco's record-breaking $25.6 billion IPO and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba's $13.5 billion secondary Hong Kong listing.  ,The two deals accounted for 6% of the total raised, with Aramco alone accounting for 15% of global IPO volumes.  ,""Aramco fits the category of large and differentiated deals for which there is an audience but equally it is such a unique asset and a unique situation that it is difficult to read across to other situations,"" said Gareth McCartney, head of Europe Middle East and Africa (EMEA) ECM syndicate at UBS. ,(GRAPHIC: Global ECM volumes saved by marquee deals - ,)  ,U.S. office-sharing tech firm WeWork was the year's highest-profile casualty after its valuation tumbled from $47 billion in a private fundraising round in January to as low as $10-$12 billion for its proposed and then canceled IPO.   ,Other notable cancellations included Reassure — the UK arm of reinsurance group Swiss Re — and Italian luxury yacht maker Ferretti. ,Kirstin DeClark, co-head of U.S. equity capital markets at Barclays, said poor share price performance by newly-listed tech firms meant investors were becoming more conservative about valuations for loss-making companies. ,""The pendulum has swung much more towards discipline.

"(Reuters) - Novartis AG (,) has secured Medicaid coverage for a pricey new sickle cell disease therapy in two U.S. states just weeks after winning U.S. approval, following an early campaign to convince local officials of its value, according to a company executive and a Reuters review of public filings.  ,The approvals from the Florida and Alabama Medicaid health programs for the poor and disabled mark exceptionally fast acceptance for the treatment, which can cost up to $113,000 annually for an individual patient, excluding discounts, said Ameet Mallik, who heads the Swiss drugmaker's U.S. oncology division. ,In November, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Adakveo and Global Blood Therapeutic Inc's (,) Oxbryta, which carries a list price of $125,000 per year. ,They are among the first therapies that aim to provide  significant relief from painful symptoms or address the cause of sickle cell disease, a potentially lethal ailment in which deformed blood cells limit the oxygen supply to parts of the body.  ,Strong uptake by Medicaid programs is central to Novartis' goal of making Adakveo a $1 billion drug, since a high percentage of sickle cell patients rely on the state-run health programs. Analysts at Cowen & Co forecast peak annual U.S. Oxbryta sales reaching $1.7 billion.  ,GBT spokesman Steven Immergut said some health plans, including private insurers as well as government-run Medicaid and Medicare, have started to cover Oxbryta on a case-by-case basis. The company said it has received positive feedback from payers in early discussions.  ,Depending on the state, Medicaid can take as long as 12-to-18 months to approve new medications, particularly expensive ones that put a strain on state budgets. GBT has said it expects most Medicaid programs to take at least three-to-six months to approve its drugs.  ,The majority of the nearly 100,000 people in the United States with sickle cell anemia are African American. Around 85 percent of sickle cell patients live in 17 U.S. states, including Florida and Alabama, and more than half are insured either by Medicare or Medicaid, according to Novartis and GBT. ,'HISTORIC TIME FOR THE SICKLE CELL COMMUNITY'       ,Adakveo is a biologic drug delivered as a once-a-month infusion to prevent the pain crises often associated with sickle cell disease. ,Oxbryta is a once daily pill that treats the disease's underlying cause by raising hemoglobin levels and preventing the breakdown of red blood cells into a sickle - or crescent moon - shape.  ,Their different impacts on the disease has raised the prospect that both drugs would be prescribed simultaneously, creating a greater cost burden to the U.S. healthcare systems.       Florida approved the Novartis drug with a requirement that patients receive prior authorization from their physician, Mallik said, meaning that the state would review any prescriptions to make sure that patients meet certain criteria. Alabama approved it without restrictions, he added.      ,Although state Medicaid programs cannot simply refuse to cover FDA-approved drugs, they can attempt to save money by moving slowly to place the drug on reimbursement formularies or by requiring patients to go through extra steps to obtain reimbursement.     A Novartis cancer therapy, Kymriah, which costs as much as $475,000, is still not covered by Medicaid in every state despite having been approved two years ago, Mallik said.          ,Both Novartis and GBT began meeting with state Medicaid officials ahead of the FDA approvals to discuss the treatment and have advocated for its inclusion on formularies, or official reimbursement lists, both companies told Reuters. ,""We have been meeting with both government and commercial payers for several months – initially educating about sickle hemoglobin polymerization and, more recently, about Oxbryta,"" Immergut said.         Patient advocacy groups, such as the state-level chapters of the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America (SCDAA), also are meeting with policymakers to encourage them to make the drug accessible to patients, said Biree Andemariam, the group's chief medical officer.  ,""This is a really historic time for the sickle cell community,"" she said. ""Patients are ready to take advantage of these new treatments.""  ,(The story corrects second paragraph to say Mallik is the U.S., not global head, of Novartis' oncology division and ninth paragraph to say Adakveo is a once-a-month infusion, not injected several times a month) ",Business News,12/20/2019 11:05,Novartis wins Medicaid approval for new sickle cell drug in key U.S. states

Netflix expanded its subscriber base from 12 million at the end of 2009 to 158 million last September. ,But at the start of 2010, when mailing DVDs to customers was still a large chunk of Netflix's business, the average analyst recommendation for the company was ""hold,"" making it one of the S&P 500 stocks least favored by analysts at that time.  ,As well as being the top overall performer across the decade, Netflix was the S&P 500's strongest annual performer in 2010, 2013 and 2015, gaining 219%, 298% and 134% in each of those years, respectively.  ,(GRAPHIC: Top S&P 500 performers by year - ,)  ,The only other S&P 500 component leading the index more than once on an annual basis over the decade was chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (,), which surged 80% last year and is on track to gain 132% in 2019.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. economic growth nudged up in the third quarter and the economy appears to have maintained the moderate pace of expansion as the year ended, supported by a strong labor market. ,Other data on Friday showed consumer spending increased solidly in November, adding to a string of upbeat data that have helped to quell recession fears which gripped financial markets in the summer.  ,The longest expansion in history, now in its 11th year, remains on track thanks to the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates three times this year. The U.S. central bank last week kept rates steady and signaled borrowing costs could remain unchanged at least through 2020.  ,Though growth has been relatively strong, economists did not expect the economy to achieve the Trump administration's 3.0% target this year. Still, the resilient economy could offer some respite for President Donald Trump who was impeached on charges of abusing his office on Wednesday by the Democratic-led House of Representatives. ,""The data will comfort the Fed that the economy is in 'a good place' and monetary policy is 'appropriate',"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ,Gross domestic product increased at a 2.1% annualized rate, the Commerce Department said in its third estimate of third-quarter GDP. That was unrevised from November's estimate. The economy grew at a 2.0% pace in the April-June period. ,Despite the unrevised estimate, which was in line with economists' expectations, consumer spending was stronger than previously reported in the third quarter.  ,There were also upgrades to business spending on nonresidential structures such as power infrastructure, which limited the drop in overall business investment. That offset downward revisions to investment in homebuilding and inventory accumulation. Imports, which are a drag to GDP growth, were higher than previously estimated. ,Growth estimates for the fourth quarter range from as low as a 1.5% rate to as high as a 2.3% pace. Growth has slowed from the 3.1% rate notched in the first three months of the year in part because of the 17-month trade war between the United States and China and the fading stimulus from last year's $1.5 trillion tax cut package.   ,When measured from the income side, the economy grew at a 2.1% rate in the last quarter, rather than the 2.4% pace estimated in November. Gross domestic income (GDI) increased at a rate of 0.9% in the second quarter.  ,The revision to the income side of the growth ledger reflected a downgrade to corporate profits. ,After-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustment, which corresponds to S&P 500 profits, were revised down to show them declining $23.1 billion, or at a rate of 1.2%. Profits were previously reported to have decreased $11.3 billion, or at a rate of 0.6% in the third quarter. ,They were in part held down by legal settlements with Facebook and Google. Profits increased at a 3.3% rate in the second quarter. The average of GDP and GDI, also referred to as gross domestic output and considered a better measure of economic activity, also increased at a 2.1% rate in the July-September period.  ,The data boosted the dollar against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street were treading higher, pushing key indexes to new record highs. ,The economy's moderate growth speed appears to have persisted in the fourth quarter. In a second report on Friday, the Commerce Department said consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.4% last month as households stepped up purchases of motor vehicles and spent more on healthcare. Consumption increased 0.3% in October. ,Consumer spending is being supported by the lowest unemployment rate in nearly half a century. But inflation stayed tame last month and could remain so for a while. The University of Michigan's survey of consumers showed households' one-year inflation expectations fell in December to 2.3%, the lowest in three years, from 2.5% in November.  ,""If this month's drop in inflation expectations is sustained or intensifies, it would be concerning to the Fed, which is trying to lift inflation, and would suggest easier monetary policy than would prevail otherwise,"" said Scott Hoyt, a senior economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. ,Despite the economy improving prospects, risks remain. Boeing's (,) decision this week to suspend production of its best-selling 737 MAX jetliner in January after two fatal crashes of the now-grounded aircraft means the fallout is likely to drag into 2020. That could pressure the fragile manufacturing sector, which was starting to stabilize as the U.S.-China trade tensions ebb. ,Economists estimate that Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years, which is expected to wreak havoc on supply chains, could cut first-quarter 2020 gross domestic product growth by at least half a percentage point. ,In the GDP report, growth in consumer spending was raised to a 3.2% rate in the third quarter from the previously reported 2.9% pace. Inventories rose at a $69.4 billion pace instead of the $79.8 billion rate reported last month.  ,Business investment dropped at a 2.3% rate in the third quarter, rather than contracting at a 2.7% pace as previously reported. Spending on nonresidential structures such as mining exploration, shafts and wells declined at a 9.9% rate instead of the previously reported 12.0% pace.

Delivery that is faster than what retail rivals can offer has been key to Prime, a paid subscription program that incentivizes its 100-plus million members to do more of their shopping on Amazon. ,In an email Friday to merchants who sell on its marketplace, Amazon said it has invested more than $15 billion this year in tools, infrastructure and programs like Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) to help sellers. ,""Driven by FREE One-Day Delivery, this was the largest one-year investment we have ever made in FBA.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The economic impact of Boeing Co's (,) planned halt of 737 MAX production will not be considered by U.S. regulators in their ongoing review of when to end the grounding of a plane involved in two major fatal crashes, U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said on Friday. ,In an interview with Reuters, Chao said the White House has not pressured the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to speed up its review. ,Chao also said the White House Council of Economic Advisers had conducted a study of the economic impact of the grounding, which forced Boeing - a critical American manufacturing company - to halt deliveries in March, and assessed that it would cause around a 0.4% reduction in U.S. gross domestic product. ,""Regardless as to what the impact on GDP is, our responsibility is to ensure that the 737 MAX must be safe before it is ungrounded,"" Chao said, adding that ""my job is protect"" the FAA from any pressure the agency might face. ,The 737 MAX has been grounded worldwide since March after two crashes involving Boeing's fastest-selling jet in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people within five months, costing the plane manufacturer more than $9 billion so far. ,On Friday, United Airlines (,) said it is extending cancellations of Boeing 737 MAX flights from early March until June.

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The mayor of a Michigan steel town was attending his grandchildren's Christmas play Thursday evening when he got an unwelcome voicemail from an official of the town's top employer: United States Steel Corp (,).  ,U.S. Steel was about to send out a press release announcing layoffs for 1,545 workers and the idling of a significant portion of operations at the Great Lakes Works facility, according to the voicemail received by Michael Bowdler, mayor of River Rouge, a city of 7,500 that sits on the Detroit River roughly 10 miles south of Detroit. ,In the voicemail to Bowdler, heard by Reuters, the U.S. Steel official called the layoffs ""terrible news"" and attributed the decision to weak demand, lower steel prices and new corporate strategy. ,Domestic steel prices, after rising in the immediate aftermath of tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump on steel imports, have fallen amid weakening demand from the auto and other manufacturing sectors.  ,In the 2016 presidential election, Trump won Michigan by less than 11,000 votes. But with its factories shedding thousands of jobs, the state is seen as up for grabs in the 2020 election. ,Steel production at Great Lakes Works will stop around April 1 and the hot-strip mill rolling facility will cease operations before the end of next year, U.S. Steel said in its statement released on Thursday. Production will be shifted to Gary Works in Indiana, the statement added. ,The latest layoffs, which would impact 94% of the Michigan facility's workforce, come months after U.S. Steel decided to temporarily lay off 48 employees at Great Lakes Works and warned of up to 200 more layoffs.  ,The Great Lakes plant primarily serves the automotive industry. It is the lifeline of the cities of Ecorse and River Rouge, which house the plant. ,Local officials had worked out a deal to give tax breaks to the company for a $600 million investment to carry out upgrades at Great Lakes Works. They thought the investment was the company's commitment to stay invested in the towns. ,In September, a U.S. Steel spokeswoman told Reuters that the incentives would help preserve jobs in the region. ,After Thursday's developments, Bowdler did not know whether the tax deal would be put before the city council for approval. ,U.S. Steel told Reuters on Friday that its discussions with the two cities about the tax deal were ""paused"" earlier this year. ,Bowdler said the company's move will result in a $1 million hit on the city's finances and could also dampen the business of its retailers. ,U.S. Steel's new strategy to ramp up investments at three mills in North America - Mon Valley plant in Pennsylvania, Gary Works in Indiana and Big River Steel in Arkansas, which the company expects to fully acquire within the next four years -  had thrown into doubt the future of the Michigan plant. ,Martin Englert, a steel industry analyst for brokerage firm Jefferies LLC, called the idling of Great Lakes an ""incremental positive"" for the company. ,U.S. Steel's stock closed down Friday about 11% at $11.91 as the company announced a dividend cut and forecast a wider-than-expected loss in the fourth quarter. The company's shares have plunged 75% since March 1, 2018, when Trump announced his decision to crack down on foreign steel imports. ,Prices of hot-rolled coil are down 41% from their 2018 peak, hurting the profits of American steel companies. U.S. Steel, which saw a record profit in 2018 on soaring steel prices, reported a loss in the latest quarter on slowing demand.

"CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - Boeing Co's (,) new astronaut capsule failed after liftoff on Friday to climb high enough in orbit to reach the International Space Station, cutting short a critical unmanned test mission in the embattled aerospace giant's race to send humans to the orbital outpost. ,The CST-100 Starliner astronaut capsule was successfully launched from Cape Canaveral in Florida, but an automated timer error, which Boeing could not immediately explain, prevented the spacecraft from attaining the orbit that would have put it on track to rendezvous and dock with the space station, NASA said. ,The Starliner's debut launch to orbit was a milestone test for Boeing, which is vying with SpaceX, the privately held rocket company of billionaire high-tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, to revive NASA's human spaceflight capabilities. SpaceX carried out a successful unmanned flight of its Crew Dragon capsule to the space station in March. ,GRAPHIC: Space missions - ,  ,The Starliner setback came as Boeing, whose shares dropped 1.6% on the day, sought an engineering and public relations victory in a year punctuated by a corporate crisis over the grounding of its 737 MAX jetliner following two fatal crashes of that aircraft. ,The implications for any further design and testing requirements before Starliner is approved for its first crewed mission also remained unclear. The prospect that Boeing might need to repeat an unmanned orbital test flight could substantially delay NASA's timeline and drive up costs.  ,The plan now is for the capsule to return to Earth on Sunday, about a week ahead of schedule, parachuting to the ground at its designated landing site in White Sands, New Mexico, Boeing's space chief executive, Jim Chilton, said. ,The craft, while stable, has already burned too much fuel to risk further maneuvers trying to dock with the space station at this point, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said at a news conference. ,Boeing officials said they were still seeking to pinpoint the cause of Friday's glitch.  ,""The spacecraft was not on the timer we expected her to be on,"" Chilton told reporters. ""We don't know if something happened to cause it to be that way."" ,The spacecraft, a cone-shaped pod with seats for seven astronauts, lifted off from Cape Canaveral at 6:36 a.m. (1136 GMT) atop an Atlas V rocket supplied by Boeing-Lockheed Martin Corp's (,) United Launch Alliance.  ,Minutes after launch, Starliner separated from the two main rocket boosters, aiming for a link-up with the space station on Saturday some 254 miles (409 km) above Earth. But difficulties ensued with thrusters designed to boost the capsule's orbit to the proper altitude. ,""When the spacecraft separated from the launch vehicle we did not get the orbital insertion burn that we were hoping for,"" Bridenstine said. ,Bridenstine said the timer error caused the capsule to burn much of its fuel too soon, preventing it from reaching the desired orbit. NASA and Boeing tried to manually correct the automated errors, but mission control commands sent across NASA's satellite communications network were inexplicably delayed. ,""The challenge here has to do with automation,"" Bridenstine said, adding that astronauts on board would have been able to override the system that caused the malfunction. ,Bridenstine said he would not rule out the possibility of allowing Boeing to proceed directly to its first crewed Starliner flight, depending on findings from the investigation of Friday's mishap. ,Nicole Mann, one of three astronauts slated to fly on Boeing's first crewed flight test, told reporters, ""We are looking forward to flying on Starliner. We don't have any safety concerns."" ,​NASA astronaut Mike Fincke added, ""Had we been on board, we could have given the flight control team more options on what to do in this situation."" ,Friday's test represented one of the most daunting milestones required by NASA's Commercial Crew Program to certify a capsule for eventual human spaceflight - a long-delayed goal set back years by development hurdles at both Boeing and SpaceX. ,The U.S. space agency awarded $4.2 billion to Boeing and $2.5 billion to SpaceX in 2014 to develop separate capsule systems capable of ferrying astronauts to the space station from U.S. soil for the first time since NASA's space shuttle program ended in 2011. NASA has since relied on Russian spacecraft for hitching rides to the space station.  ,NASA initially had expected to begin crewed flights aboard the Starliner and the Crew Dragon capsules in late 2017. Both companies are currently aiming for next year, a time frame reinforced in a statement on Friday from the office of U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who chairs the National Space Council. ,""Vice President Pence was assured that NASA will continue to test and improve, in order to return American astronauts to space on American rockets in 2020,"" it said. ,In a message of sympathy for his Boeing rival, Musk said on Twitter, ""Orbit is hard,"" adding, ""Best wishes for landing & swift recovery to next mission.""  ,Occupying one of Starliner's astronaut seats on Friday was a mannequin named Rosie, outfitted with sensors to measure the pressure a real astronaut would endure on ascent to the space station and during hypersonic re-entry back through Earth's atmosphere. ,(This story has been refiled to add dropped word in headline)  ",Business News,12/20/2019 11:55,Boeing's Starliner astronaut capsule fails key test to reach space station
"(Reuters) - PG&E Corp's (,) creditors have sweetened their offer to California wildfire victims, saying they are now prepared to pay $13.5 billion in cash upfront, according to a letter sent on Friday to state governor Gavin Newsom. ,Current terms of the settlement deal, approved by a U.S. bankruptcy judge on Tuesday, call for half of the settlement to be financed with stock in a newly reorganized PG&E. ,In the letter, the bondholders led by Elliott Management said their latest proposals will make sure individual victims ""are prioritized, as they should be"" and will address demands Newsom had raised earlier. ,Newsom said on Dec. 13 that the settlement had lacked major changes in governance and tougher safety enforcement mechanisms mandated under the state wildfire statute. It would also leave the company with a weakened capital structure and ""limited ability to withstand future financial and operational headwinds."" ,The new plan calls for no debt at the reorganized holding company and a new board with residents from California forming the majority of directors.  ,It also allows for a takeover of PG&E by the state if the company is found to have caused any single future wildfire that destroys more than 5,000 structures.  ,PG&E said after the disclosure of the letter that it is continuing to talk with the stakeholders. Newsom's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment after business hours on Friday. ,PG&E said earlier it had reached a deal with labor, safety and customer advocacy groups calling for regulators to allow PG&E to implement some rate increases for funding wildfire-prevention efforts and safety improvements. ,A term sheet submitted with Friday's letter showed utility customer rate increases will be capped at 3% through 2023. ,PG&E filed for Chapter 11 protection in January, citing potential liabilities in excess of $30 billion from deadly wildfires in 2017 and 2018 linked to its equipment. ,It came under renewed criticism this year for precautionary power outages to guard against the risk of wildfires posed by extremely dry and windy weather.

"SEATTLE/CAPE CANAVERAL (Reuters) - Boeing Co's (,) stunted Friday debut of its astronaut capsule threatens to dent the U.S. aerospace incumbent's self-declared competitive advantage of mission reliability against the price and innovation strengths of ""new space"" players like Elon Musk's SpaceX. ,Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company, has anchored its attempt to repel space visionaries like Musk and Amazon.com (,) founder Jeff Bezos partly on its mission safety record built up over decades of space travel.  ,While SpaceX and Bezos' Blue Origin are racing to send their own crewed missions to space for the first time, Boeing or Boeing heritage companies have built every American spacecraft that has transported astronauts into space. And the single-use rockets it builds in partnership with Lockheed Martin Corp (,) have a virtually unblemished record of mission success.  ,""We are starting from a position of mission reliability and safety,"" Boeing Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg told Reuters earlier this year when asked about SpaceX and other insurgents aiming to disrupt Boeing on everything from astronaut capsules to rockets to satellites. ,""There is a difference between putting cargo in space and putting humans in space, and that's a big step. Our very deliberate, safety-based approach for things like CST-100, that will be a differentiator in the long run,"" Muilenburg said. ,The actual technical glitch that stunted Friday's CST-100 Starliner mission to the International Space Station was a timer error though Boeing said it was too early to determine the exact cause of the fault.  ,Boeing was already working to surmount other technical and safety-related challenges on the multibillion-dollar NASA human spaceflight program. A government watchdog report in November found Boeing demanded ""unnecessary"" new contract funds from NASA. ,Friday's glitch adds to a year of intense scrutiny over how Boeing developed its money-spinning 737 MAX jetliner following twin crashes that killed 346 people in five months. ,While there is no link between the 737 MAX crashes and the Starliner setback, one rocket industry executive told Reuters that in both cases problems arose as Boeing was racing to catch up with fast-moving rivals. ,Boeing had no immediate comment.  ,""From a public relations standpoint, this error makes them not look so good because of all the 737 MAX issues,"" said Teal Group space analyst Marco Caceres. ""If you look at this in isolation, I don't think of it as a massive problem for Boeing. There are only two companies picked for this program – that is an enviable place for Boeing to be, as long as nothing tragic happens."" ,SpaceX successfully launched its own rival Crew Dragon astronaut capsule on a roundtrip journey to the ISS earlier this year, though it faces its own technical problems. ,It is challenging Boeing's space business more broadly by slashing the cost of accessing space with pioneering reusable rocket technology. ,Bezos' Blue Origin is also developing rockets and capsules for human and cargo space flights. ,SpaceX is working toward a manned mission in first-quarter 2020.

"(Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Justice Department said a federal appeals court should reverse a lower court verdict finding Bayer AG liable in the case of a California man who blamed its Roundup weed killer for his cancer. ,The government said in a friend of the court brief filed on Friday that glyphosate, the weed killer's active ingredient, is not a carcinogen and as a result a warning on the label was not required as California state law demands. ,The backing by the EPA and Justice Department comes days after Bayer asked a U.S. federal appeals court to throw out a $25 million judgment it was ordered to pay Edwin Hardeman. Bayer had denied its Roundup weed killer causes cancer. ,In April, the EPA reaffirmed that glyphosate does not cause cancer. ,Farmers spray glyphosate, the most widely used herbicide in U.S. agriculture, on fields of soybeans and other crops that are genetically engineered to resist it.

"(Reuters) - The Boeing Co Starliner spacecraft that failed to hit the right orbit to reach the International Space Station is healthy, in a stable orbit and expected to land in New Mexico on Sunday morning, NASA said. ,Boeing's (,) CST-100 Starliner astronaut capsule was successfully launched from Florida on Friday, but an automated timer error prevented the spacecraft from attaining the correct orbit for it to rendezvous and dock with the space station.  ,NASA and Boeing officials said on a Saturday conference call they are still investigating the cause of the failure and that they were surprised extensive testing before the flight did not turn up any problem.          ,The spacecraft's challenges were not over, they said. ,""Entry, descent and landing is not for the faint of heart,"" said Jim Chilton, senior vice president of Boeing's space division. ""Make no mistake, we still have something to prove here on entry tomorrow."" ,The Starliner's debut launch to orbit was a milestone test for Boeing, which is vying with SpaceX, the privately held rocket company of billionaire high-tech entrepreneur Elon Musk, to revive NASA's human spaceflight capabilities. SpaceX carried out a successful unmanned flight of its Crew Dragon capsule to the space station in March. ,The Starliner setback came as Boeing sought an engineering and public relations victory in a year punctuated by a corporate crisis over the grounding of its 737 MAX jetliner following two fatal crashes of the aircraft. The company's shares dropped 1.6% on Friday. ,The implications for any further design and testing requirements before Starliner is approved for its first crewed mission also remained unclear. The prospect that Boeing might need to repeat an unmanned orbital test flight could substantially delay NASA's timeline and drive up costs.    ,Chilton said on Saturday that the plan now is for Starliner to return to Earth early Sunday morning at White Sands, New Mexico, about a week ahead of schedule.  ,LIFT-OFF ,The spacecraft, a cone-shaped pod with seats for seven astronauts, lifted off from Cape Canaveral before dawn on Friday atop an Atlas V rocket supplied by Boeing-Lockheed Martin Corp's (,) United Launch Alliance.  ,Minutes after launch, Starliner separated from the two main rocket boosters, aiming for a link-up with the space station some 254 miles (409 km) above Earth. But problems with Boeing's autonomous software caused the capsule to incorrectly sense what orbit it was in so that it fired the wrong thrusters for longer than necessary, burning too much of its fuel, too soon.  ,NASA and Boeing tried to manually correct the automated errors, but mission control commands sent across NASA's satellite communications network were delayed because Starliner was in the wrong position in space.  ,Friday's test represented one of the most daunting milestones required by NASA's Commercial Crew Program to certify a capsule for eventual human spaceflight - a long-delayed goal set back years by development hurdles at both Boeing and SpaceX. ,The U.S. space agency awarded $4.2 billion to Boeing and $2.5 billion to SpaceX in 2014 to develop separate capsule systems capable of ferrying astronauts to the space station from U.S. soil for the first time since NASA's space shuttle program ended in 2011. NASA has since relied on Russian spacecraft for hitching rides to the space station. ,Chilton said Friday's failure would not dissuade Boeing from sticking to its quest to win the right to provide NASA's astronaut capsules, saying, ""We're in, it's as simple as that.""

"LONDON (Reuters) - From Harley Davidson to Colgate-Palmolive, U.S. companies are flocking to borrow in euros and their record issuance is breathing life into a market where yields have been hammered by the European Central Bank's renewed stimulus push. ,Offshore fundraising by U.S. firms — dubbed the ""reverse Yankee"" in reference to Yankee bonds, which are sold by foreign entities in the United States — has been a regular feature of the euro debt market. But issuance by non-financial, investment-grade U.S. firms has quadrupled this year from 2018 levels, to around 93 billion euros ($103 billion), Dealogic data shows. ,That accounted for 27% of a total 346 billion euros ($383 billion) of euro-denominated investment-grade corporate bond issuance, according to the data.  ,From pharmaceuticals to consumer goods makers to fintech, the reverse Yankee has become the go-to market for U.S. companies which are now the largest source of corporate bond sales in Europe, according to BofA.  ,And if the boom extends into 2020, the United States would become the largest country in the ICE-BofA euro zone corporate debt index, overtaking France, the bank says.  ,The rush is driven primarily by rock-bottom borrowing costs in the euro zone, where interest rates are at minus 0.5% and the average yield on corporate euro-denominated bonds has fallen to 0.48% — down from 1.25% at the start of 2019. ,European credit markets offer ""the best funding conditions for global issuers"" said BofA's head of credit strategy Barnaby Martin. ""They're not going to be able to find that anywhere else.""  ,Euro issuance allows U.S. borrowers to replace high-coupon, shorter-dated dollar debt with longer, lower-coupon euro debt. That lowers financing costs and improves the results of companies with euro-denominated assets, said Marc Baigneres, head of Western Europe investment-grade finance at JPMorgan. ,Mergers and acquisitions are another factor — fintech Fidelity National Information Services, for example, raised 5 billion euros back in May as part of a multi-currency deal to finance its purchase of card payment firm Worldpay. ,Graphic: Share of outstanding euro-denominated debt , ,The reverse Yankee boom is welcome news for European bond buyers dismayed at the yield collapse triggered by the ECB's asset purchase program.  ,The euro zone's central bank, which resumed buying bonds in October, holds 183 billion euros of corporate debt. Toward the end of quantitative easing a year ago, it was estimated to hold a fifth of the eligible corporate debt stock.  ,Because reverse Yankees are not usually eligible for ECB purchases, they often carry higher yields than similarly rated euro zone issues. They also made up a significant chunk of this year's longer-maturity debt, including half the 30-year corporate bonds sold, according to Refinitiv.  ,These longer, higher-yield issues are especially popular with investors. ,Triple B-rated reverse Yankee bonds of seven to 10 years' maturity can offer a spread of up to 25 basis points more than euro zone equivalents that are eligible for ECB purchase, research company CreditSights calculates.  ,BofA's Martin reckons U.S. names could lure giant Asian life insurers to invest in euro debt. These investors hold over 10% of the U.S. credit market, International Monetary Fund data shows, but they are less familiar with euro zone companies. ,""If many of the U.S. issuers come in euro format, it's easier for (insurers) to buy euro investment-grade,"" Martin said. ""It will create additional demand and it will be bullish for the market.""  ,Graphic: Reverse Yankee bond issuance jumps in 2019 , ,With the ECB expected to stick with stimulus and the U.S. Federal Reserve not cutting rates for now, analysts predict reverse Yankee issuance will exceed 2019 levels next year. ,Companies such as Amazon and Visa which have significant euro revenues but no euro debt could tap the market, said BofA, which expects reverse Yankees' share of the index to rise to 20.8% by November 2020, from the current 18%. ,But the greater presence of American companies could create additional risk, warns Rachid Semaoune, a credit fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, because U.S. corporate behavior differs from that of European peers. ,Commerzbank estimates that U.S. firms had a free cash flow level of around minus $300 billion in 2018 — the ninth straight year of negative flows. That is a measure of how much cash a company will have after capital spending to pay bond and equity investors.  ,The figure in Europe was around zero. ,""It's a worry because U.S. corporates are a lot more aggressive in their financial policy, and in terms of shareholder returns, either in the form of share buybacks and special dividends, which are detrimental to bondholders,"" Semaoune said. ,Graphic: Corporate bond yields plunge in 2019 , ",Business News,12/23/2019 7:10,The Yankees are coming!

With a $3.9 trillion market value (versus around $100 billion in January 2010), tech giants Facebook, Amazon.com, Apple, Netflix and Google-owner Alphabet — collectively known as the FAANGs — are not only at the vanguard of history's longest share bullrun but have transformed how humans work, shop, consume news and relax. ,FAANGs comprise 7% of the MSCI global equity index today, up from around 1.6% in early 2010. The savvy investor who sank $25,000 in Netflix in 2009 would now be sitting on $1 million. ,And in the slip stream of the five pioneers, other tech titans are rising, from China's BAT grouping of Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent to sector ""disupters"" Uber, Airbnb and Deliveroo. For better or worse, the world — and markets — have changed for ever.      ,(GRAPHIC: Rise of the FAANGs - ,)     ,A defining feature of the years following the 2008-2009 meltdown was the slide of interest rates and government borrowing costs below 0%, possibly for the first time in history. U.S. and German 10-year borrowing costs collapsed by 200 to 400 basis points this decade; the latter to as low as minus 0.7%. Roughly $12 trillion in debt carries negative yields, almost a quarter of all bonds outstanding. ,The drivers — central banks' asset buying, sub-zero interest rates, yield curve manipulation and the tech revolution's deflationary effects — were in themselves groundbreaking, at least in terms of scale. The Bank of Japan holds assets collectively worth more than Japan's economy. The European Central Bank's balance sheet is a quarter the euro zone's annual output but double decade-ago levels. ,Interactive graphic on central bank balance sheet , ,(GRAPHIC: Borrowing costs collapsed in the 2010s - ,)         ,With record-low rates and yield-starved investors, bonds with tenors longer than the average human lifespan have caught on.  ,A handful of 100-year bonds were around in 2010, but Mexico's $1 billion issue maturing 2110 started an issuance surge that saw U.S. and British universities, Ireland, Belgium and Austria, U.S. municipalities and corporations such as Coca Cola and Petrobras sell century bonds. Even junk-rated serial defaulter Argentina drew huge bids for its 2117-maturity bond.   ,Just over 1,400 century bonds, worth almost $170 billion are now outstanding, according to Refinitiv.  ,But ... caveat emptor. Buyers of the Argentine century bond have watched it lose half its value. Austria's issue, also sold in 2017, is up more than 60%.

Ten years later, cryptocurrencies are intertwined with finance, business and politics. ,Crypto markets, non-existent in 2010, are now worth over $200 billion, having hit a $815 billion peak at the apex of the bitcoin bubble. Having changed hands for just 3 cents in its first public trade, bitcoin now trades over $7,500. That's off its peak near $20,000, though - a reminder of its volatility. Usage has also spread. Coin Metrics estimates that from 130 active bitcoin addresses a decade back, there are now nearly 750,000. ,Crypto took many guises through the 2010s, from rebel technology to a tool for criminals, speculative token to the great hope for frictionless payments. While it never really shook off doubts over security, virtual money and blockchain tech have evolved at a dizzying pace, typified recently by Facebook's push to launch its Libra token and steps by central banks to create their own digital currencies. ,Interactive graphic , ,(GRAPHIC: Bitcoin in the 2010s - ,)     ,Sometimes it's better to be passive. The punter who opted to ride the past decade's equity boom via an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tracking the S&P500 would have earned 200% but at a fraction of the fee a mutual fund manager would have charged. Hence spectacular ETF growth — assets have swelled to almost $7 trillion, from below $2 trillion in 2010, consultancy ETFGI says. Low investment fees should help extend the boom: total ETF assets could hit $50 trillion in 2030, BofA predicts.     ,(GRAPHIC: ETF asset upsurge -  ,)    ,With the hottest four years on record occurring in the past four years (according to the  World Meteorological Organization), climate is shaping investor thinking in a way it did not a decade ago.  ,Crop failures, floods and wildfires can all inflict portfolio losses. More funds are reducing exposure to polluting industries, embracing renewables and water conservation technologies or investing in the likes of fake-meat firm Beyond Meat, whose 2019 IPO was greeted with rapture on Wall Street.  ,Over $30 trillion is held in sustainable or green investments, the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance estimates, more than doubling from 2011.  ,Green bonds debuted in 2007 to fund projects with environment benefits. This year, issuance totaled a record $200 billion-plus. ,(GRAPHIC: Green bond issuance ends decade with record year - ,) ,Having learned to wring oil from shale with fracking, the United States has vaulted to the top of the  oil producer rankings, with 12.5 million barrels per day of output, double 2010 levels. Shale oil production exceeds 9 million bpd, from below one million bpd in 2010, making the United States an oil exporter for the first time in 40 years. ,The shale boom is partly why conversations around energy have switched from peak supply to peak demand. Surging output comes alongside environmental concerns, meaning an oil glut is likelier than shortages. Interactive chart , ,(GRAPHIC: U.S. crude oil production, 2000-2019 - ,)     ,Having relied for over a century on the internal combustion engine, the global auto industry is being upended by battery-powered cars. In 2010, electric car maker Tesla went public and its shares, launched at $17, now trade at $380.  ,Hundreds of billions of dollars have been pledged to develop a new generation of electric cars. Industries supplying car batteries are booming and demand for their main component, lithium, could triple by 2025. ,EV sales so far have disappointed — two out of 100 cars sold today are electric. Petrol and diesel vehicles are cheaper and EV charging infrastructure is limited.  ,But growing alarm over climate change and government incentives to steer consumers away from petrol means the electric revolution looks unstoppable.     ,(GRAPHIC: Tesla's first decade - ,)     ,Tech's transformative power has not bypassed currency trading floors. Ten years ago, dealers did the buying and selling for banks and clients. Today, electronic trading comprises 90% of some products, doubling in this period. Another shift is toward ""algos"" — computer programs that follow pre-set instructions, or algorithms, to trade, often at speeds impossible for humans. ,From being largely nonexistent a decade ago, algo trading now comprises a fifth of FX spot volumes on Refinitiv FXall, a platform for the buyside. On another venue EBS, over 80% of the order book is algo-driven, the Bank for International Settlements estimates. ,One side effect is that 'flash crashes' — wild exchange rate swings — have become frequent, ostensibly due to algos that are programmed to turn off if markets become volatile.     ,The winners? Those who can afford the most sophisticated algos. Almost half of global currency trading is now with the top five banks, with smaller institutions — and of course, traders — having to exit.     ,(GRAPHIC: Algorithmic vs manual on EBS - ,)     ,Marijuana took a trip this decade from street corners to stock markets. The first pure-play U.S. ""potstock"" — Tilray — debuted on NasDaq in 2018, leaping 36% on the first day. And 18 months since Canada legalized recreational cannabis, hundreds of potstocks are trading. ,Pot also spawned one of the decade's asset bubbles. Dubbed the green rush, shares in firms such as Aurora Cannabis and Canopy Growth rose several-fold before peaking in October 2018. At their high, the 10 biggest components of a potstock benchmark, the Alternative Harvest ETF, were worth $50 billion. ,A year later, $30 billion had gone up in smoke. Blame regulation and overproduction hitting weed prices. A sign of a maturing industry? The highs may have evaporated, but potstocks aren't going anywhere. Except perhaps London, which may host the next set of cannabis listings in 2020.

"ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse (,) on Monday admitted to snooping on another of the bank's former executives, deepening a spying scandal at the Swiss group, which is already under investigation for putting its ex-wealth management chief under surveillance. ,Switzerland's second-largest bank blamed former chief operating officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee for hiring detectives in February to track former HR head Peter Goerke. They described a rogue operation in which all executives and directors, including Chief Executive Officer Tidjane Thiam, were kept in the dark about what was going on. ,Credit Suisse had earlier blamed Bouee for a similar incident involving former wealth management boss Iqbal Khan and had also cleared Thiam of any role in it. At the time, Thiam characterized it as an ""isolated incident"". ,Reuters was not immediately able to reach Bouee and Goerke for comment. ,""The observation of Peter Goerke, which has now been confirmed, is inexcusable,"" Credit Suisse Chairman Urs Rohner said in a statement, adding there was ""grave concern"" that those responsible for ordering the surveillance had not mentioned it during an earlier probe regarding Khan. ,""We are aware that the observation of Iqbal Khan and Peter Goerke have damaged the reputation of our bank,"" Rohner said. ,Goerke had no knowledge that he had been followed by private detectives until officials from the bank contacted him shortly before Swiss newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung made the matter public last Monday, a person familiar with his thinking said.  ,Goerke, who remains employed by the bank as an adviser, saw no grounds to pursue the matter criminally, the person said, and was in contact with senior officials at Credit Suisse. ,Credit Suisse has been in the spotlight since September when Khan filed a criminal complaint in Zurich after a confrontation  between him and one of the private detectives tailing him.  ,The bank launched an investigation and found it had bankrolled the surveillance. ,An investigation by law firm Homburger into the spying on Khan — who now works for rival UBS (,) — had found Bouee and a security boss under him were alone responsible for the order and found no evidence of other incidents. ,Both resigned and Credit Suisse said on Monday that Bouee's employment had now been terminated for cause, indicating his bonus and other potential compensation would likely be forfeited. Bouee was a long-time associate of Thiam and had followed him to Credit Suisse from Prudential (,).  ,Harris Associates, the bank's third-largest investor, according to Refinitiv data, remained positive.  ,""We are extremely supportive of the CS executive management team - a team that we believe has greatly improved CS over the last four years,"" David Herro, manager of the firm's Oakmark International Fund, told Reuters. ,Switzerland's finance watchdog is looking into the bank's surveillance activities and its corporate governance. There is also a criminal probe into the Khan affair. ,A Credit Suisse spokesman said Credit Suisse and Homburger would continue their latest probe having determined that Bouee and others involved had not told the truth when asked about any other surveillance orders in September and had taken care not to leave any identifiable traces in the bank's systems. ,""Credit Suisse will look into any relevant indications if we receive information about alleged (surveillance),"" he said. ,Credit Suisse stock was down 0.4% at 1530 GMT while the European bank sector index .SX7P was off 0.7%.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - New orders for key U.S.-made capital goods barely rose in November and shipments fell, suggesting business investment will probably remain a drag on economic growth in the fourth quarter. ,The White House's 17-month-old trade war with China has hurt business confidence, undermining capital expenditure. Despite a recent easing of tensions, regional manufacturing surveys showed business confidence remaining subdued in December.  ,Even if business confidence were to improve in early 2020, a surge in capital expenditure is unlikely. Boeing (,) announced last week it would suspend production of its best-selling 737 MAX jetliner in January as fallout from two fatal crashes of the now-grounded aircraft drags into 2020. Boeing on Monday ousted Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg. ,""We expect industrial momentum will remain muted in 2020 amid an environment of sluggish global growth, persistent trade policy uncertainty and subdued corporate profitability,"" said Oren Klachkin, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics in New York. ""Boeing's decision to halt production of the 737 MAX will present a continuing drag on orders."" ,The Commerce Department said orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft, a closely watched proxy for business spending plans, edged up 0.1% last month as a surge in demand for electrical equipment, appliances and components was partially offset by a drop in machinery orders. ,These so-called core capital goods orders rose by an unrevised 1.1% in October. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast core capital goods orders gaining 0.2% in November. ,Core capital goods orders rose 0.7% on a year-on-year basis in November.  ,The dollar held near a two-week high against a basket of currencies, while U.S. Treasury prices slipped. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher, with Boeing shares surging following   Muilenburg's ousting. ,Shipments of core capital goods dropped 0.3% last month. Core capital goods shipments are used to calculate equipment spending in the government's gross domestic product measurement. Core capital goods shipments rose by a downwardly revised 0.7% in October. They were previously reported to have jumped 0.8%. ,Economists said the weak core capital goods shipments posed a downside risk to fourth-quarter GDP growth estimates, which range from as low as a 1.5% annualized rate to as high as a 2.3% pace. The economy grew 2.1% in the third quarter. ,While manufacturing is struggling, the housing market is steadily rising, driven by the Federal Reserve's three interest rate cuts this year. In a second report on Monday, the Commerce Department said new home sales rebounded 1.3% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 719,000 units last month, lifted by gains in activity in the Northeast and West regions.  ,October's sales pace was, however, revised down to 710,000 units from the previously reported 733,000 units. New home sales are volatile on a month-to-month basis because they are drawn from a small sample of houses selected from building permits. Sales jumped 16.9% from a year ago. ,""We expect housing activity to remain supported with now-lower mortgage rates and a Fed on hold, but do not expect a further substantial pick-up in activity into 2020,"" said Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup in New York. ,Business investment has contracted for two straight quarters, with weak spending on equipment and nonresidential structures such as gas and oil well drilling contributing to the decline that has pushed manufacturing into recession. ,Boeing's biggest assembly-line halt in more than 20 years is expected to disrupt supply chains, further depressing manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the economy. Economists estimated the suspension of the 737 MAX aircraft production could cut first-quarter 2020 gross domestic product growth by at least half a percentage point. ,Last month, overall orders for durable goods, items ranging from toasters to aircraft that are meant to last three years or more, tumbled 2.0% after gaining 0.2% in the prior month. ,Durable goods orders were held down by a 72.7% plunge in demand for defense aircraft orders and parts last month. Economists expect a rebound after the U.S. Congress passed a huge defense spending bill last week.  ,""The big, bipartisan defense bill that passed Congress last week ensures defense spending will be robust next year, however,"" said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. ""It's not a recipe for gangbusters growth, but capital spending should no longer detract from growth next year."" ,Orders for transportation equipment dropped 5.9% after edging up 0.1% in October. Motor vehicles and parts orders increased 1.9% in November as the end of a strike at General Motors (,) boosted auto production. Orders for non-defense aircraft and parts fell 1.8% last month. ,Overall shipments of durable goods nudged up 0.1% in November, reversing October's 0.1% drop. Durable goods inventories increased 0.4% last month. They have risen in 16 of the last 17 months. Unfilled durable goods orders fell 0.4% in November after being unchanged in October.

"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc shares traded above $420 on Monday, more than a year after Elon Musk tweeted he had ""funding secured"" to take the electric car maker private at that price, only to later give up under investor pressure and regulatory concerns. ,In recent months, Tesla's shares have had a run of good fortune on the back of a rare quarterly profit reported in October, news of production ramp-up in its China factory and upbeat early deposits for its recently launched electric pickup truck. ,Orders for the company's Cybertruck have reached close to the record set by its Model 3 sedans in 2016. ,""Whoa … the stock is so high lol,"" Musk tweeted on Monday, after Tesla shares crossed the $420 mark. (,) ,The number 420 is closely associated with marijuana as a slang for the consumption of cannabis. It also refers to cannabis-related celebrations that take place annually on April 20. ,The take-private tweet in August last year, at a time when Tesla was trading in the mid-$330s, had taken shares as high as $387. Later in the month, shares were closer to $320 amid intense regulatory scrutiny. ,The U.S. Securities and Exchange commission fined Musk and Tesla $20 million each for the $420 tweet. Musk was also forced to step down as chairman and must submit any public statements about Tesla's finances and other topics to be vetted by a legal counsel. ,Reuters reported earlier on Monday the company and a group of Chinese banks have agreed to a new 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion), five-year loan facility for the automaker's Shanghai car plant. ,Tesla shares rose over 3.6% in Monday's session and are up nearly 65% since the quarterly report in October.

"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - U.S. electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (,) and a group of China banks have agreed a new 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion), five-year loan facility for the automaker's Shanghai car plant, three sources familiar with the matter said, part of which will be used to roll over an existing loan. ,China Construction Bank (,) (,) (CCB), Agricultural Bank of China (,) (,) (AgBank), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (,) (,) (ICBC) and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (,) (SPDB) are among the banks which have agreed to give Tesla the financial support, one source with direct knowledge said.  ,The Chinese banks earlier this year already offered Tesla a 12-month facility of up to 3.5 billion yuan, which is due to be repaid on March 4, 2020, according to a filing the automaker made to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ,That new loan will be partially used to roll over the previous 3.5 billion yuan debt, according to the first source. The second source said the rest will be used on the factory and Tesla's China operations. ,The new loan's interest rate will be pegged at 90% of China's one-year benchmark interest rate, the same as the 3.5 billion yuan loan, the first source said. This is a rate that China banks offer to their best clients.  ,Tesla, CCB, AgBank, ICBC and SPDB did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. ,Tesla broke ground on the factory in January and has started producing vehicles from its Shanghai plant. It aims to build at least 1,000 Model 3 cars a week by the end of this year. ,The factory, which is Tesla's first car manufacturing site outside the United States, is the centerpiece of its ambitions to boost sales in the world's biggest auto market and avoid higher import tariffs imposed on U.S.-made cars.  ,The Shanghai government has also thrown its support behind the Tesla project, which would be China's first wholly foreign-owned car plant and a reflection of the government's broader shift to open up its car market. ,Tesla shares rose to over 3.6% in Monday's session to cross $420 for the first time.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Marshal Cohen has religiously visited the same stores every holiday season since 1999.  ,But rather than snapping up bargains and favorite gifts for friends and family, the chief retail industry adviser is there to scrutinize the purchasing habits of others as online shopping upends the retail business. ,Major shifts in consumer behavior and preferences have forced Cohen, who works for market research firm NPD Group, and other retail analysts to approach their jobs very differently than two decades ago. ,""If you were to try and replicate research methodology, or even store observation, in today's world, you've got a problem,"" Cohen told Reuters. ""It's no longer good enough to just look at store traffic or parking lot counts."" ,Cohen and his peers need to get it right because their insights, reported to investors and retail clients, influence marketing, move share prices and guide investment decisions. ,A record number of U.S. consumers spending more online, coupled with a condensed holiday shopping season and year-round discount wars among retailers, has forced analysts to get creative, with many shifting away from old-school tactics to measure a company's overall performance. ,Instead of simply asking shoppers why they left a store empty-handed, analysts are probing the effect of online giant Amazon.com Inc, asking whether customers started Christmas shopping in July on Prime Day, now a major event in the annual retail calendar to rival Thanksgiving weekend's Black Friday. ,Calculation of sales per square foot is giving way to a tally of how many Instagram-native, exclusive and private fashion brands are offered on a retailer's sales floor and website, and analysts — rather than simply seeing how many bags a shopper leaves with — are now counting how many younger millennial and Gen Z shoppers frequent a store and whether they make a purchase.  ,Craig Johnson of Consumer Growth Partners says that traditional metrics such as foot traffic, average selling price, and average basket size can often still be highly indicative of what's happening in stores. ,But other retail analysts said online shopping and a slew of services like ""buy online, pick up in-store"" can hinder the ability to estimate a retailer's conversion rate - a traditional measure of the proportion of visitors who make purchases. ,Brian Field, senior director of global retail consulting for ShopperTrak, part of retail data firm Sensormatic Solutions, said it was particularly difficult to figure out if traffic reported by retailers came from people buying items in-store or shoppers picking up online orders. ""It is kind of synonymous with the fact that retailers are reporting blended sales, which include sales online and sales in-store together,"" Field said.   ,""I think what it really boils down to is the customer journey has changed - it can start anywhere, in-store, online and end anywhere."" ,When Marie Driscoll, Coresight Research's managing director of luxury and fashion, received an email from Saks Fifth Avenue less than a week before Black Friday alerting her that several small leather designer goods such as wallets were on sale, she took note. ,The department store, she thought, might have been struggling to sell such items, which are often given as gifts. ,Saks, owned by Hudson's Bay Company, disagreed. ,""It would be flawed to gauge category performance based on customer emails, as the majority include personalized recommendations derived from a client's shopping preferences,"" a company spokesperson said. ,Consumer Growth Partners' Johnson keeps close tabs on how many fashion brands born on Instagram are on the sales floor when he visits Nordstrom Inc these days. That tells him whether the retailer is catering to young shoppers who search for labels on their smartphones. ,A source with knowledge of the matter said Nordstrom looks for opportunities to launch new brands and expand existing partnerships with limited distribution and emerging brands to differentiate their product line. ,U.S holiday retail sales during November and December are expected to increase by around 4% from 2018 to as much as $730.7 billion, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF) - a percentage rise dwarfed by the 13.6% annual jump Adobe Analytics has already seen in online sales between Nov. 1 and Dec. 19, to $125.6 billion. Smartphones accounted for 35.3% of that revenue. ,But analysts say retail companies are providing too little information too late, forcing them to draw conclusions from very limited data.  ,""You don't get the full holiday picture until months later...Until (the retailers) actually report, you're flying blind,"" said Charlie O'Shea, who has worked as a retail analyst for Moody's for 17 years covering Walmart Inc, Target Corp, and Best Buy Co Inc among others. ,""All the retailers talk about is sales...we need to know how much money you made,"" he added. ,O'Shea says he sometimes uses third party sales data and Adobe Insights data for online numbers. ,""You're looking at a stew here...with a bunch of different ingredients, and then you just try and frame a picture.""

"(Reuters) - U.S. budget carrier Spirit Airlines Inc (,) said on Monday it will buy 100 Airbus (,) A320neo-family jets to be delivered through 2027, with options to purchase up to 50 additional aircraft. ,The deal includes a mix of Airbus A319, A320, and A321 models, the company said. ,The purchase agreement finalizes an October provisional deal for the aircraft, when Spirit picked European planes despite Washington imposing tariffs on them. ,Depending on the number of each variant of the A320 single-aisle family chosen, the deal could be worth $11 billion to $12 billion at the most recent 2018 Airbus list prices, but industry sources say such deals typically involve discounts of at least 50%. ,Washington has imposed 10% tariffs on some of the planes Airbus offers to U.S. carriers, as part of a long-running transatlantic trade dispute over aircraft subsidies. ,Spirit currently operates an all-Airbus fleet of 140 jets. ,Aircraft are typically ordered several years in advance, meaning any planes ordered now would only be covered by tariffs in the event of an extended transatlantic tariff war.

"(Reuters) - Boeing Co has fired Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg after repeatedly failing to contain the fallout from a pair of fatal crashes that halted output of its best-selling jetliner and tarnished its reputation with airlines and regulators. ,Boeing - beset by one setback after another following the two air disasters - dropped Muilenburg as it became increasingly clear that he was making little headway resolving a crisis that has cost it $9 billion, hurt suppliers and airlines and now threatens to cut the pace of U.S. economic growth. ,Chairman David Calhoun, a former General Electric executive who has been on the Boeing board since 2009, will take over as CEO and president, effective from Jan. 13, Boeing said. Until then, Chief Financial Officer Greg Smith will run the world's largest planemaker. ,""The board of directors decided that a change in leadership was necessary to restore confidence,"" a Boeing statement said. A Boeing official said the board had deliberated over the weekend and decided to oust Muilenburg in a phone call on Sunday. ,Muilenburg could not be reached for comment. ,Boeing shares, which have dropped more than 20% over the past nine months, closed up 2.9%. ,The 737 MAX has been grounded since March after two crashes in Indonesia and Ethiopia killed 346 people within five months. ,Boeing is struggling to mend relations with the U.S. and international regulators it needs to win over to get the jet back in the air. ,After keeping assembly lines open and storing 400 planes to be ready for a return to flight, Boeing acknowledged this month it would not be able to reach its target of flying this year and announced it would halt 737 MAX production in January. ,Boeing on Monday said shipments from 737 suppliers will be suspended for a month starting mid-January, adding that it was uncertain when production would restart. ,Economists estimate that will lower overall U.S. economic growth by half a percentage point. ,Muilenburg's departure followed a week of dramatic setbacks for Boeing, which vies with Europe's Airbus for leadership of the $150 billion jet industry. ,They ranged from a decision to halt production of the MAX, to a public slap-down from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), a ratings downgrade and a space launch glitch on Friday. ,Late Monday, the FAA confirmed it had received a new batch of documents from Boeing related to the MAX and was reviewing them. A person briefed on the matter confirmed a Seattle Times report that the new submission contained instant messages from a former Boeing senior pilot, Mark Forkner. ,In October, Boeing turned over 2016 messages to the FAA between Forkner and another pilot that said he might have unintentionally misled the FAA and raised questions about the performance of a key safety system during testing. Boeing had earlier turned over the documents to the Justice Department, which has an ongoing criminal investigation into the MAX. ,Based on Boeing securities filings, Muilenburg may be eligible for nearly $39 million in severance. Boeing declined to comment on the figure or whether he would accept it. ,Boeing said last month Muilenburg had volunteered to give up his 2019 bonus and stock awards. For 2018, his bonus and equity awards amounted to some $20 million, according to filings. ,His dismissal received backing from Peter DeFazio, chair of the U.S. House of Representatives' transportation committee.  ,""It's clear Dennis Muilenburg's ouster was long overdue,"" he said. ""Under his watch, a long-admired company made a number of devastating decisions that suggest profit took priority over safety."" ,Calhoun, who is resigning from Blackstone to take the top job at Boeing, was respected by the industry, said aerospace analyst Richard Aboulafia of Teal Group. ,""But long term, does he bring the right tool kit? Private equity leans companies out. That's not Boeing's problem right now."" ,Boeing - which has taken flak from the Federal Aviation Administration for appearing to pressure the regulator by predicting when the MAX fly - pledged full transparency. It named a veteran PR boss from the auto industry. ,""We don't think it is controversial to suggest that Boeing's MAX response has been a failure - and as a result we think it is wholly appropriate for the board to replace Muilenburg,"" said Robert Stallard, analyst at Vertical Research Partners. ,Muilenburg, an engineer who started at Boeing as an intern in 1985, fought a rising tide of public and regulatory scrutiny to try to steady the company during the crisis. He initiated a broad safety initiative involving heavy investments in training but was unable to shake off a set of awkward public appearances. ,Muilenburg acknowledged errors in failing to give pilots more information on a stall-prevention system before the crashes and for taking months to disclose that it had made optional an alarm that alerts pilots to a mismatch of flight data. ,""We've made mistakes and we got some things wrong. We're improving and we're learning,"" he told lawmakers in October.  ,Speculation that he would be fired had been circulating in the industry for months, intensifying in October when the board stripped him of his chairman title - although he had also twice won expressions of confidence from Calhoun. ,Muilenburg was credited with halting a drift in the company's defense division and reshaping Boeing's management. ,But by keeping Muilenburg as long as it did, some experts say Boeing ignored part of the crisis communications playbook. ,""You want to bring somebody from the outside to bring fresh perspective to 'save the day,'"" said Paul Argenti, a professor at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business.

"PARIS (Reuters) - As Boeing's (,) new boss tackles the immediate crisis over its grounded 737 MAX jet, he also faces pressing questions from European regulators over a deal to buy the commercial arm of Brazil's Embraer - seen as key to its longer-term strategy. ,European Union regulators investigating the $4.2 billion tie-up have asked for more than 1.5 million pages of information and data on over 20 years of sales campaigns, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.  ,The volume of requests highlights the European Commission's concerns over a deal it suspects would reduce the number of major participants in the global jet market from three to two, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ,Any delay or derailing of the transaction would be a further setback for Boeing, which on Monday named David Calhoun as its new CEO amid a crisis over the grounding of its top-selling 737 MAX following two fatal crashes. ,Calhoun knows Embraer from his former senior role at engine maker General Electric (,) and is expected to push hard for the tie-up, one industry source said.  ,Boeing has agreed to buy 80% of Embraer's (,) commercial jets division which competes with Europe's Airbus (,) in the market for planes below 150 seats.  ,Airbus had earlier bought the main competitor to Embraer's 80-120-seat E2 jet family from Canada's Bombardier and is racking up sales of the renamed A220 while its U.S. rival's  takeover of Embraer makes slow progress. ,Originally set for 2019, the Boeing-Embraer deal was delayed after the Commission decided in October to deepen a competition probe, now scheduled to end in late February. ,The sources said the Commission had requested the extra data on top of the hundreds of thousands of pieces of information shared by other regulators, and that it was examining data on over 1,000 actual or potential sales campaigns over two decades. ,U.S. sources deny the deal would reduce the market from three to two players, saying the mainline and regional markets are separate, even though Airbus has a foot in both camps. ,Lawyers on all sides are now waiting to see whether the Commission launches a ""statement of objections,"" a step that can lead to a request for concessions to secure approval.  ,The Commission and companies all declined to comment. ,The United States, Japan and China have approved the deal and Brazil is expected to confirm preliminary backing soon. ,Airbus and Boeing share the market for jets above 150 seats and their deals with Bombardier and Embraer respectively are extending their rivalry into smaller, regional jets.  ,Beyond the battle between the E2 and the A220, broader issues are at stake as the two companies lay the foundation for longer-term contests against China. , ,Boeing is interested in Embraer's lower-cost engineering, industrial footprint and technology such as landing gear. That means Embraer is likely to play a key role in developing the portfolio that eventually replaces jets including the MAX.  ,The probe also intensifies a noisy European battleground for Boeing as it faces questions from Europe's safety agency over the MAX and the likelihood in 2020 of EU counter-tariffs after Washington taxed Airbus jets in a subsidy dispute. ,European officials deny any link between competition and trade dossiers, but EU experts say the simultaneous challenges reflect Europe's growing international muscle as its regulators speak with a louder voice on multiple fronts. ,Without linking the Embraer case to the subsidy dispute, Airbus is anxious to ensure a level U.S. playing field for the A220, which has already been targeted with separate U.S. tariffs that were later overturned, one European trade source said. ,Airbus has held several contacts with officials probing the deal and incoming CEO Guillaume Faury met the EU's Competition Commissioner in March, people familiar with the talks said. ,A U.S. industry source said top-level contacts early in the process are unusual and Brazilian reports say Airbus has argued against the deal. An Airbus spokesman said any claims that it was lobbying the EU against the deal were ""without substance"".  ,U.S. and Brazilian sources say Airbus is using its market power to offer attractive deals for the A220 packaged with other jets, and can only benefit from further delays in the Boeing-Embraer link-up. ,European sources say the A220's success reflects a newer design and reduced uncertainty over its future under Airbus. They deny Airbus is winning by cross-selling with larger jets. ",Business News,12/24/2019 11:50,New Boeing boss faces EU pressure over Embraer tie-up: sources
"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican businesses are concerned that a tweak to dispute resolution mechanisms under a new North American trade deal could be used to stifle exports, top industry associations say. ,Revised terms were agreed this month for the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), a deal replacing the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), after months of wrangling to ensure tougher labor standards in Mexico. ,The United States had proposed sending inspectors to monitor Mexican labor practices in an effort to ensure its southern neighbor is not unfairly undercutting U.S. competitors. ,Mexico resisted this proposal, and the two sides finally agreed on an addendum that would create panels to oversee Mexico's compliance with its own labor laws. ,But businesses fear the details of how disputes are settled through the panels could hinder export activity. ,The USMCA addendum says the panels are not to restrict trade but also states that ""upon delivering the (complaint) to the respondent party, the complainant party may delay final settlement of customs accounts related to entries of goods."" ,""We're waiting for what the interpretation will be, since the plaintiff can block the defendant's exports,"" said Lorenzo Roel, head of the labor commission at Mexican employers' confederation Coparmex. ""That's one of the concerns."" ,Roel said disputes had been used to hold up Mexican exports in the past and called for a monitoring commission to be set up. ,Mexico's economy ministry said it would work with the United States and Canada to ensure firms are not subject to abuses. ,""We will have a monitoring system with the labor ministry along with the private sector,"" the ministry told Reuters. ,Kenneth Smith, Mexico's lead USMCA negotiator from 2017-18, flagged his concern about the new language, saying on Twitter that it risked ""imposing border measures against companies accused of labor violations BEFORE the panel's decision.""  ,Smith said the amendment should be corrected in the first periodic revision of the USMCA, which is still awaiting final ratification in the United States and Canada. ,Mexican industry association Concamin said more care could have gone into setting out the dispute panel rules. ,""Many (USMCA) chapters were rushed ... their interpretation isn't 100% clear,"" said Concamin president Francisco Cervantes.

"NAIROBI/ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Days after the March 10 crash of a Kenya-bound Ethiopian Airlines' Boeing jet that killed all 157 people on board, strangers began calling or visiting bereaved families, saying they represented U.S. law firms. ,They showed up uninvited at memorials and at homes full of weeping relatives. They cold called. They left brochures. In one case a grieving husband was offered money for an appointment. One woman offered counseling and another said she was creating an emotional support group, without disclosing they were working for lawyers.  ,Reuters interviewed 37 relatives of the victims, or their representatives, and found that 31 complained of inappropriate approaches by those saying they represented U.S. law firms. ,In some instances, the behavior may have been illegal or unethical under U.S. laws and rules barring solicitation and deceptive practices, several legal ethics experts said. ,Six firms were particularly aggressive in courting prospective clients after the Boeing plane nosedived into an Ethiopian field: Ribbeck Law Chartered and Global Aviation Law Group (GALG) of Chicago; The Witherspoon Law Group and Ramji Law Group from Texas; and Wheeler & Franks Law Firm PC and Eaves Law Firm of Mississippi. ,Witherspoon, Wheeler, Eaves and Ramji denied any wrongdoing. Ribbeck and GALG did not respond to requests for comment. ,Ribbeck Law and GALG have jointly filed two lawsuits against Boeing seeking ""all damages available under the law"" without being specific about the size of the claims. Three suits filed by Ramji have been dismissed. The other firms haven't filed any suits. ,By Thursday, there were 114 cases filed against Boeing in Chicago federal court on behalf of 112 crash victims, according to lead counsel for the plaintiffs, Robert Clifford. More than three dozen law firms are representing them. No trial date has been set. ,Boeing has said it is ""cooperating fully with the investigating authorities"" and said that safety is its highest priority. ,It has acknowledged errors in failing to give pilots more information on 737 MAX software involved in a Lion Air crash that killed 189 in Indonesia in October 2018 and the Ethiopian crash five months later, but Boeing has not admitted any fault in how it developed the aircraft. The 737 MAX is currently grounded. ,Boeing declined to comment on the lawsuits. ,An uninvited stranger turned up at Paul Njoroge's family home in Kenya just hours after a memorial service for his wife, his three small children, and his mother-in-law, who all died in the crash.     ,Njoroge said the visitor gave him promotional materials for the law firm Wheeler and Franks.    ,""I said, I don't know who directed you to this place. Everyone here is praying,"" Njoroge told Reuters.      ,Two other families said they received visits around the time of memorial services from Wheeler's lawyers or people who said they represented the firm.    James Ndeda, who Wheeler represented after he was injured in the 1998 embassy bombing in Kenya, said he visited Njoroge. The firm's partners, Bill Wheeler and Jamie Franks, asked Ndeda to help the firm connect with crash victims' families, Ndeda said. Wheeler sent him literature featuring his firm and another Mississippi firm, Eaves Law Firm. ,Ndeda said he went to visit victims' families either by himself, sent employees or accompanied Bill Wheeler or Jamie Franks, and sometimes Leo Jackson, an investigator with Eaves. Jackson declined to comment.       ,Wheeler and Franks, and Eaves, said in a joint emailed statement they only met families if invited.  ,""The story you have been told is completely wrong,"" they wrote. ""We contacted no families without an invitation."" ,They declined to answer further questions. ,Ethiopian Bayihe Demissie, whose flight attendant wife Elsabet was a victim, told Reuters a man who said he was from The Witherspoon Law Group called him three days after the crash. Bayihe said he was too upset to speak. ,People saying they represented more than 30 firms contacted him over the next few months, including Witherspoon again, and GALG, said Bayihe. The constant calls about compensation hurt because it felt like people were suggesting he could benefit from his wife's death, he said. ,Witherspoon denied the allegations. ,""This firm does not solicit or engage in any illegal practices. We do not represent any of the families involved in the tragic crash,"" Witherspoon's founder Nuru Witherspoon said in an email. ,A woman named Mihret Girma sent a Kenyan victim's family a message in August, inviting them to attend a meeting with a grief counselor and the Law Society of Kenya.  ,At that time, she did not reveal she had ties to the firms GALG and Ribbeck, according to the family, who shared messages received from Mihret.  ,Mihret was in a WhatsApp group with GALG staff and U.S. lawyers Manuel Ribbeck and Monica Ribbeck Kelly within three weeks of the March crash, other messages reviewed by Reuters show. Dozens of the messages show GALG staff and the Ribbecks discussing how to reach bereaved families. ,Mihret did not return calls or messages seeking comment. ,The Illinois state disciplinary commission censured Monica Ribbeck in 2014 for filing an aviation accident suit on behalf of someone who had already terminated her.  ,In 2015, the commission's hearing board recommended she be suspended for 60 days for filing what it alleged was a frivolous action for legal discovery over the disappearance of Malaysian Airlines' Flight 370. That was overturned after a review. ,This year, the Ribbecks set up a new entity, GALG, according to messages between GALG and the Ribbecks that have been viewed by Reuters. GALG staff directed clients to the Ribbecks, messages and emails shared by several bereaved families show. ,GALG set up its website on March 28, only 18 days after the accident, and filed its articles of incorporation in Illinois on April 24.  ,Amos Mbicha, whose sister and nephew died in the crash, said he helped more than 10 law firms, including GALG, connect with bereaved families. He said he stopped working with GALG in October when the firm tried to contact a victim's relative after he had warned them not to. ,Neither Ribbeck nor GALG responded to requests for comment. Monica Ribbeck did not return multiple email and phone messages from Reuters. ,While many families interviewed by Reuters say they turned away cold callers, they typically wound up retaining lawyers after doing their own research. ,""Not all the lawyers are bad. If we say that, Boeing wins. We needed to find someone to get justice,"" said Tom Kabau, a Kenyan lawyer who lost his younger brother George in the crash and whose family has hired Husain Law and Associates and Wisner Law Firm. ,Lawyers representing victims of airline crashes can get millions of dollars in fees if they win or settle cases in U.S. courts, where there can be large payouts. ,Awards against an airline are capped if it was not negligent. But there is no limit for manufacturers, making lawsuits against Boeing potentially lucrative. ,Plaintiffs' lawyers in these kinds of cases don't usually charge fees up front but take at least 20 percent of any settlement or award. That standard practice is being followed in the Ethiopian crash cases, bereaved families say. ,Beyond the aggressive approaches by certain firms, in Ethiopia, one lawyer offered to pay for access.  ,Adam Ramji of Texas-based Ramji Law Group sent Bayihe six messages in 20 minutes on July 13, and offered cash in exchange for a meeting, according to Bayihe and a review of his text messages. ,""Let me give you $100 for 15 min of your time,"" Ramji wrote. ,Bayihe has since filed a suit through Chicago-based Clifford Law Offices, telling Reuters he deliberately sought out a lawyer who had not pitched to him. ,Ramji filed three lawsuits in Chicago. A judge threw out two of them after the families concerned said the names of the ""executors"" of the estate who were named as the lawsuits' plaintiffs were unknown to them.  A third suit was dismissed because there was no person by that name aboard the flight. ,After Reuters published this article, Ramji sent an email denying wrongdoing. He said that all of the individuals his firm spoke with had contacted the firm or responded to ads.  ,Ramji said that on some occasions, ""we did offer the destitute transportation money."" ,Asked about the dismissed cases, Ramji said that ""people pretend to be who they are not"" and that ""attrition is normal in all business.""  ,U.S. states have ethics rules that prohibit lawyers or anyone acting on their behalf from soliciting business by phone or in person, in most cases over any time period. ,They also bar lawyers from giving anything of value to solicit a prospective client. ,There is also a U.S. federal law that forbids lawyers from contacting victims' families within 45 days but it appears to be only applicable to U.S. aviation accidents, according to two legal experts. ,Contacted about the cases cited in this story, Robert Glen Waddle, director and counsel at the Mississippi Bar's Consumer Assistance Program, declined comment. Steven Splitt, spokesman at the disciplinary commission of the Illinois bar, and a spokeswoman for the Texas disciplinary board, also declined to comment. ,U.S. disciplinary boards often don't have the resources to investigate complaints from abroad, said Jim Grogan, former deputy administrator and chief counsel at the Illinois bar disciplinary commission.  ,""There are so many shadows in which people can act, especially abroad,"" said Grogan.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices rose on Tuesday in thin pre-Christmas trading after Russia said cooperation with OPEC on supply cuts would continue and amid optimism that the United States and China could finalize a trade agreement. ,Brent crude LCOc1 settled up 81 cents, or 1.22%, at $67.20 a barrel after a shortened session ahead of the Christmas holiday. U.S. West Texas Intermediate CLc1 settled up 59 cents, or 0.97%, at $61.11 a barrel. ,OPEC and Russia will continue their cooperation as long as it is ""effective and brings results,"" Russian energy minister Alexander Novak said in an interview on Monday. ,OPEC and allies agreed in November to extend and deepen output curbs in place since 2017. Under the reduced output, as much as 2.1 million barrels per day (bpd) could be taken off the market, or about 2% of global demand. ,Still, OPEC needs to do more to balance the market on a sustainable basis, Bjornar Tonhaugen, head of oil market research at Rystad Energy, said in a note. ,""The OPEC cuts didn't fully solve the problem – instead they offer a light bandage to get through the first quarter of 2020,"" said Tonhaugen. ,The market also rose as U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he and Chinese President Xi Jinping will have a signing ceremony to sign the first phase of the U.S.-China trade deal agreed to this month.. Trade tensions between the two countries have weighed on the oil market because of worries of a slowdown in demand growth.  ,Still, the market faces headwinds from growing supply. ,A deal signed on Tuesday between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia on the Neutral Zone between the two countries could add to supply next year. The agreement aims to end a five-year dispute between the OPEC members and reopen fields which can produce 0.5 million bpd, or 0.5% of global supply.  ,U.S. oil major Chevron Corp (,), which helps operate the fields, said full production was expected within 12 months.  ,While the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has been cutting production, U.S. producers have been filling the gap, pumping ever greater amounts of crude to reach a record high of about 13 million bpd in November. ,That has helped swell inventories with U.S. stocks up about 1% this year.  ,Crude stocks, however, are expected to have fallen by about 1.8 million barrels last week, a second week of declines,  according to a preliminary Reuters poll. ,The weekly government report on inventories has been delayed by two days due to Christmas. The report is normally released on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. EST (1530 GMT). ",Business News,12/24/2019 1:38,Oil rises on supply cut pledges and slow return of Gulf field
"YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - The executive tasked with leading a recovery at Nissan Motor Co Ltd said he had decided to resign just weeks into his new job, a move that could disrupt the automaker's push to turn the corner on scandal and slumping sales. ,Jun Seki, Nissan's vice chief operating officer and a former contender for chief executive, told Reuters he was leaving to become the president of Nidec Corp, a Kyoto-based manufacturer of automotive components and precision motors. ,He will likely depart in January after three decades at Nissan, including a stint heading its China business. ,""I love Nissan and I feel bad about leaving the turnaround work unfinished, but I am 58 years old, and this is an offer I could not refuse. It's probably my last chance to lead a company too,"" he said in a brief interview.  ,""It's not about money. In fact, I will take a financial hit since Nissan pays us well,"" Seki said. He declined to elaborate further. ,Nissan and Nidec declined to comment.  ,Seeking to roll back some of the costly expansion under ousted chairman Carlos Ghosn, Nissan has embarked on wide-ranging turnaround plan.  ,That plan, which began in April, is now on track to generate a cumulative few hundred billion yen in cost cuts and operational efficiency gains by the year to March 2022, according to two Nissan sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. One hundred billion yen is roughly equal to $915 million. ,Adding to concerns about disruption among Nissan's top management, the sources said that Seki, Chief Operating Officer Ashwani Gupta and Chief Executive Makoto Uchida have so far failed to gel as a team after being named to their posts in October. ,They officially took over on Dec. 1. ,""There was no instant, cohesive chemistry achieved by those appointments,"" one of the sources said.  ,Gupta and Uchida were not immediately available for comment. ,Seki's resignation could further complicate Nissan's relationship with top shareholder Renault SA. Seki recently worked in Paris for a year and was seen as relatively close to the French automaker. ,Asked if he was leaving Nissan because he was passed over for the role of chief executive, Seki said that was not the case but did not elaborate. ,He and Uchida, most recently the head of the China business, had been seen as top contenders for the CEO job. Reuters reported in September that Uchida was seen as more favored by Renault. ,Before being named vice-COO, Seki was a senior vice-president charged with leading the turnaround. ,Nissan has been profoundly shaken over the last year, first with the downfall of long-term leader Ghosn, who is now awaiting trial on allegations of financial misconduct that he has denied. Former Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa then left in September. ,One of the sources said Seki was contacted by a headhunter about a job at Nidec in April, after he returned from a year working in Paris. ,Nidec's 75-year-old chairman, the brash and confident Shigenobu Nagamori, has been searching for an eventual successor to lead and expand its business. ,Nidec, which sees electric vehicles as a key driver of growth, has a 40% global market share in automotive electric steering motors and has said it wants to boost its share in electric vehicle propulsion motors. ,After April, Seki had no additional contact with Nidec until the recruiter called him again on Oct. 8 when Nissan announced the new management team, including Uchida as CEO. ,After that second call, Seki agreed to meet Nagamori - to turn down the offer, the source said. ,""Nagamori talked Seki into accepting his offer in the end,"" the source said.     ",Business News,12/24/2019 11:11,Nissan top executive Seki to resign in blow to turnaround plan
