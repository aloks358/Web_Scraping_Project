"DETROIT (Reuters) - A U.S. regulator said it will review part of a recommendation made last fall that India's Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd (,) infringed upon the intellectual property rights of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' (,) Jeep SUV design. ,The International Trade Commission (ITC) on Wednesday said it would review an administrative law judge's initial determination last November that Mahindra's Roxor off-road utility vehicle infringed on the ""trade dress"" of FCA's Jeep. The judge recommended the commission bar entry of Mahindra vehicles or parts that infringe and issue a cease-and-desist order. ,Trade dress consists of the unique characteristics that make a product stand apart and is generally accepted as identified with that product by the public. For example, FCA sees Jeep's grille and round headlights as distinct to the brand. ,The commission, which in September 2018 initially opened its investigation, said on Wednesday it is targeting completion of the inquiry by March 20.  ,If the ITC recommends a form of remedy, the U.S. Trade Representative would have 60 days to approve, disapprove or take no action on that determination. ,Mahindra, which previously has called FCA's claims without merit, on Thursday welcomed the commission's review. ,""We are optimistic that the ITC will in its review conclude that FCA did not establish previously unclaimed U.S. rights in trade dress and that there was no infringement of either trade dress or registered trademarks,"" the company said in an emailed statement.  ,Mahindra said it has launched its model year 2020 Roxor with what it described as ""significant styling changes"" and said it would make additional changes if the ITC required it. ,FCA was unconcerned the commission will overturn the judge's initial recommendation. ,""Review is a part of the commission process,"" the Italian-American automaker said in an emailed statement on Thursday. ""Based on the facts and law, FCA US remains confident the administrative law judge's initial determination of violation by Mahindra will be adopted by the commission."" ,The Roxor is assembled in Auburn Hills, north of Detroit, by Mahindra's North American subsidiary.

"(Reuters) - Procter & Gamble Co (,) on Thursday posted quarterly sales that missed analysts' expectations for the first time in five quarters, hurt by weakness in baby and feminine care products such as Pampers diapers and Tampax tampons. ,Shares in P&G were flat in early trading.  ,A slowing global birthrate has hit P&G and competitors like Huggies diapers maker Kimberly-Clark (,), particularly in China and the United States. To boost sales, both companies have invested in higher-priced premium products.  ,Premium baby-care sales in China are up 20-30% so there are still opportunities despite the slow birthrate, Chief Operating Officer Jon Moeller said on a post-earnings call.  ,U.S. sales growth for diapers and baby care was about flat from a year ago and innovation in the market remains competitive, Moeller said. ,The company said net sales rose 4.6% to $18.24 billion, which missed the average analyst estimate of $18.37 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.  ,Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy said Wall Street expectations were built on the company's momentum in the past five quarters, but the modest second-quarter results are likely to be met with disappointment.  ,""Good quarter, but high bar,"" he wrote in a note to clients. ,In 2018, P&G launched Pampers Pure, plant-based diapers made with zero chlorine bleaching, fragrance or parabens. It has recently teamed up with Google to make a smartphone app that alerts parents when a diaper needs changing. Similarly, Kimberly Clark in July launched a premium Huggies brand, Special Delivery, made from plant-based materials like sugarcane. ,Sales of P&G's baby and feminine products rose just 1% to $4.58 billion, while sales of fabric and home care products rose 4% to $5.79 billion, both missing estimates. ,The company said inventory levels in Japan fell following a buildup before the nation's sales tax hike in October. ,Sales at the grooming business, which makes Gillette razors, rose 2% to $1.65 billion, also below estimates. The company took an $8 billion charge last year related to the unit, which faces competition from smaller rivals Harry's and Dollar Shave Club. ,P&G has been investing heavily to develop new products across all categories, improve packaging and marketing as it tries to appeal to younger consumers and fights competition from Unilever (,), Reckitt-Benckiser (,) and local upstarts. ,The company raised its fiscal 2020 forecast for core earnings per share growth to between 8% and 11% from a prior range of a rise of 5%-10%. ,Net earnings attributable to P&G rose 16.4% to $3.72 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31. Excluding one-time items, profit of $1.42 per share beat the average estimate of $1.37. ,(This story corrects typographical errors, paragraph 4) ",Business News,2020-01-23 12:22:00,P&G sales growth shy of forecasts as slowing birthrate hurts diaper sales
"(Reuters) - Tesla Inc (,) has overtaken Germany's Volkswagen (,) as the world's second most valuable carmaker behind Japan's Toyota (,), as the meteoric rise in the U.S. electric vehicle maker's shares reshuffles the global market. ,Tesla's stock has more than doubled in value in the last three months, with its market capitalization piercing $100 billion on Wednesday, a first for a listed U.S. automaker. ,During the rally, its value has leapfrogged more established global rivals: Honda (,), BMW (,), General Motors (,) and Daimler (,). On Wednesday, it eclipsed VW's $99.4 billion value. ,Toyota still holds pole position with a market cap of $233 billion. ,The recent gains have been fueled by a surprise third-quarter profit, progress at a new factory in China and better-than-expected car deliveries in the fourth quarter. ,Many investors remain skeptical that Tesla can consistently deliver profit, cash flow and growth. ,But the gains highlight growing confidence among investors about the future of electric vehicles and Tesla's shift from a niche car maker into a global leader in cleaner cars. ,A glance at its results shows it has a long way to go before it can eclipse larger rivals.  ,Based on 12-month forward sales estimates, it doesn't even appear in the top 20 in the world.

"BERLIN (Reuters) - Seven U.S. bombs from World War Two have been found in the plot of land outside Berlin where electric car pioneer Tesla (,) wants to build its first European factory, local authorities said on Thursday. ,The duds weigh about 50 kg each and explosives experts plan to defuse them in future, said a spokesman for the interior minister in the state of Brandenburg where the property is. ,Tesla has agreed to buy land in Gruenheide just outside Berlin where it wants to build a giant factory that would give its cars the ""Made in Germany"" branding. ,Tesla's local rivals are preparing to launch their own range of electric vehicles to compete with the U.S. company, whose decision to produce in Germany is sure to give BMW, Daimler's Mercedes and Volkswagen's Audi a good run for their money. ,Unexploded bombs are often found in and around German cities, where authorities evacuate residents near the site to ensure their safety while disposal experts defuse them. ,A 500 kg World War Two bomb was found in the western city of Cologne this week and similar dud was found near a main square in Berlin. ,Tesla has agreed to pay 40.91 million euros for the 300-hectare plot for its factory.

"(Reuters) - Xerox Holdings Corp (,) said on Thursday it plans to nominate 11 independent candidates to HP Inc's (,) board, seeking to take control of the personal computer maker after several rejections of its $33.5 billion buyout offer. ,The U.S. printer maker made the cash-and-stock offer to HP, a company more than three times its size, in November. HP's board rejected the offer saying it significantly undervalued the company. ,""HP shareholders have told us they believe our acquisition proposal will bring tremendous value, which is why we lined up $24 billion in binding financing commitments and a slate of highly qualified director candidates,"" John Visentin, Xerox's CEO, said on Thursday. ,HP, which has 12 board members, responded to Xerox's decision to nominate candidates by again saying the bid undervalues the company. ,""These nominations are a self-serving tactic by Xerox to advance its proposal, which significantly undervalues HP and creates meaningful risk to the detriment of HP shareholders,"" HP said in the statement. ,Xerox's slate of candidates include current or former executives from companies such as American Airlines (,), Cognizant Technology Solutions (,), Jefferies (,) and Wynn Resorts (,). ,Both HP and Xerox have been facing a decline in demand as corporate clients choose to send emails rather than print out documents. ,While some Wall Street analysts have said a merger would help the companies in a declining printing market, others have cited challenges to integration, given their different offerings and pricing models. ,""I don't think (the nomination) puts enough pressure on HP to agree to a merger, but it may cause HP to consider negotiations for a higher valuation from Xerox,"" Morningstar analyst Mark Cash said. ,Activist investor Carl Icahn, who has a 4.2% stake in HP and a 10.9% stake in Xerox, in December urged HP shareholders who agreed to the merger to reach out to the PC maker's directors for immediate action. ,Shares of Xerox were down about 1% at $36.09 while HP's shares were up 0.7%.

"(Reuters) - Comcast Corp (,) on Thursday beat Wall Street's revenue and profit estimates due to growth in broadband customers, but the company lost more cable TV subscribers than Wall Street expected and its NBC Universal unit revenues were hurt as the film ""Cats"" bombed at the box office. ,Management said on the earnings call that it expected accelerating cable TV subscriber declines, which helped push the stock down 1.3%. Other media company shares were also down.  ,""With the rate adjustments that we are implementing in 2020 as well as the ongoing changes in consumer behavior, we expect higher video subscriber losses this year,"" said Chief Financial Officer Michael Cavanagh.  ,Pay TV companies have been raising rates instead of trying to hang on to bargain-chasers who are cutting cable service.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices fell more than 2% on Thursday on concern that the spread of a respiratory virus from China could lower fuel demand if it stunts economic growth, but losses were limited by a drawdown in U.S. crude inventories.  ,Brent crude LCOc1 futures lost $1.46, or 2.3%, to $61.75 a barrel by 11:12 a.m. EST (1612 GMT), after having touched $61.25 a barrel, lowest since early December. ,U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude CLc1 futures fell $1.45, or 2.6%, to $55.29 a barrel.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits increased less than expected last week, suggesting the labor market continues to tighten even as job growth is slowing. ,Labor market strength is underpinning consumer spending, helping to keep the longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year, on track, despite a downturn in manufacturing. ,""Employers are not cutting positions outside of the normal churn of the labor market and workers are incredibly confident in their job prospects, and not taking the time to file a claim if they are laid off,"" said Maria Cosma, an economist at Moody's Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania.  ,Initial claims for state unemployment benefits rose 6,000 to a seasonally adjusted 211,000 for the week ended Jan. 18, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Claims had declined for five straight weeks, resulting in the unwinding of the surge seen in early December, which was blamed on a later-than-normal Thanksgiving Day. ,Claims data for the prior week was revised to show 1,000 more applications received than previously reported. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast claims increasing to 215,000 in the latest week.  ,The Labor Department said claims for Alabama, California, Delaware, Hawaii, Kansas, Puerto Rico and Virginia were estimated because of Monday's Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday, which left authorities with less time to compile the data. ,The four-week moving average of initial claims, considered a better measure of labor market trends as it irons out week-to-week volatility, fell 3,250 to 213,250 last week, the lowest level since September. ,U.S. financial markets were little moved by the data, with investors focusing their attention elsewhere. The dollar edged up against a basket of currencies after the European Central Bank left unchanged its key interest rates and stimulus programs. U.S. Treasury prices rose, while stocks on Wall Street fell on rising worries over the coronavirus outbreak in China. ,Last week's claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of January's employment report.  ,The four-week moving average of claims dropped 12,500 between the December and January survey periods, suggesting some pickup in job growth this month. ,The economy created 145,000 jobs last month after adding a massive 256,000 positions in November. The slowdown in job growth has been blamed on a shortage of workers and ebbing demand in some industries like manufacturing, which has been hammered by trade tensions and problems at Boeing (,). ,Boeing this month suspended production of its troubled 737 MAX jetliner, with ripple effects down the supply chain. Boeing's biggest supplier Spirit AeroSystems Holdings (,) said early this month it planned to lay off more than 20% of the workforce at its Wichita, Kansas base.  ,Despite the low level of claims, the data have been showing layoffs in manufacturing, as well as transportation and warehousing, construction, educational service and accommodation and food services industries from late 2019 through mid-January.  ,That fits in with the Federal Reserve's Beige Book, which last week showed ""most districts cited widespread labor shortages as a factor constraining job growth,"" and ""a number of districts reported job cuts or reduced hiring among manufacturers,"" as well as ""scattered reports of job cuts in the transportation and energy sectors,"" at the tail end of 2019. ,""The jury is out on whether this signals a soft patch for the monthly payroll figures in January,"" said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG in New York. ,Despite the moderation in job gains, the labor market remains on solid footing, with the unemployment rate holding near a 50-year low of 3.5% in December and a measure of labor market slack dropping to an all-time low of 6.7%. ,Thursday's claims report also showed the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid dropped 37,000 to 1.73 million for the week ended Jan. 11. The so-called continuing claims had surged to 1.80 million at the end of 2019, which was the highest level since April 2018. The jump was blamed on year-end volatility. ,The four-week moving average of the so-called continuing claims increased 2,000 to 1.76 million in the most recent week.

"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - iPhone maker Apple on Thursday pushed back against EU lawmakers' call for a common charger, warning the move could hamper innovation, create a mountain of electronic waste and irk consumers. ,Apple's comments came a week after lawmakers at the European Parliament called for a common charger for all mobile phones and amended a draft law to say the ability to work with common chargers would be an essential requirement for radio equipment in the bloc. ,A move to a common charger would affect Apple more than any other companies as its iPhones and most of its products are powered by its Lightning cable, whereas Android devices are powered by USB-C connectors. ,""We believe regulation that forces conformity across the type of connector built into all smartphones stifles innovation rather than encouraging it, and would harm consumers in Europe and the economy as a whole,"" Apple said in a statement. ,It said regulation was not needed as the industry is already moving to USB-C through a connector or cable assembly.  ,""We hope the (European) Commission will continue to seek a solution that does not restrict the industry's ability to innovate,"" Apple said. ,A study by Copenhagen Economics commissioned by Apple showed that consumer harm from a regulatory-mandated move to a common charger would cost at least 1.5 billion euros, outweighing the 13 million euros in associated environmental benefits. ,The European Commission, which acts as the executive for the EU, has been pushing for a common charger for more than a decade. ,In 2009 it got four companies including Apple, Samsung, Huawei [HWT.UL] and Nokia to sign a voluntary memorandum of understanding to harmonize chargers for new models of smartphones coming into the market in 2011. ,The voluntary approach is not working and it is time to look into legislation, Commission officials said. ,""A delegated act based on the Radio Equipment Directive (RED) is one of the options to be considered since it empowers the Commission to take certain type of regulatory measures in this field,"" the one of the officials said.  ,Another option was to pass legislation on the issue. ,""...given the limitation in the scope of RED and of its empowerment, any action through ordinary legislative procedure and/or through other instruments, such as implementing measures under the Eco-design Directive should be further explored and thoroughly assessed,"" the official said. ,The Commission will publish a study around the end of the month or early February on the impact of a common charger.
