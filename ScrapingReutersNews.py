# (1) Extend the original file to pull up 3000+ pages (original code supported 2 pages)

# Next step:
# Write the CSV file into Pandas dataframe and start manipulating it
# Count all of the words and their frequencies in a giant dictionary
# Classify them in types (economics, markets, company-specific, etc)
# (Can I also write something about sentiment?)
# (Do some NLP magic with them)

# Extra work: All of this work was for just the business news section
# You can also extend it to the market news section (if the xpath structure is similar)

# You would essentially be repeating the same project twice (once for business news
# and once again for market news)
